# Scratchpad: Factorial Polynomials and Their Roots

## Factorial Polynomials

The generalized factorial polynomial $P(x, a, m)$ is defined as:
$$
P(x, a, m) = x(x - a)(x - 2a)\cdots(x - (m-1)a)
$$
- It is a degree $m$ polynomial.
- The roots are at $x = 0, a, 2a, 3a, \ldots, (m-1)a$.

## Properties

- For $a=1$, $P(x, 1, m)$ is the falling factorial: $x^{\underline{m}} = x(x-1)\cdots(x-m+1)$.
- For $a=-1$, $P(x, -1, m)$ is the rising factorial: $x^{\overline{m}} = x(x+1)\cdots(x+m-1)$.
- The spacing between roots is uniform, determined by $a$.

## Brainstorming Applications

- **Polynomial interpolation:** Factorial polynomials can be used as basis functions for interpolation at equally spaced nodes.
- **Combinatorics:** They appear in the explicit formulas for generalized Stirling numbers.
- **Difference equations:** Useful for expressing solutions to discrete analogs of differential equations.
- **Root structure:** The uniform root spacing may simplify spectral methods or discrete transforms.

## Questions

- How do the coefficients of $P(x, a, m)$ relate to binomial or Stirling numbers?
- Can we generalize to non-uniform root spacing?
- What is the behavior for complex $a$?
- How do these polynomials interact with convolution or composition operations?

## Example

For $a=2$, $m=4$:
$$
P(x, 2, 4) = x(x-2)(x-4)(x-6)
$$
Roots: $0, 2, 4, 6$

## Notes

- Useful for scratch work, testing ideas, and exploring connections between factorial polynomials and combinatorial identities.
- Can be extended to matrix polynomials, operator theory, or numerical analysis.
