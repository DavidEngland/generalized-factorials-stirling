### James Stirling (1692-1770)

The **Stirling numbers** are named after James Stirling, a Scottish mathematician of the 18th century. Born in Garden, Stirlingshire, Stirling made significant contributions to mathematics, particularly in the fields of analysis, infinite series, and differential equations. He is best known for "Stirling's formula," an approximation for factorials that is crucial in probability theory and statistical physics.

Stirling faced challenges in his academic career due to his Jacobite sympathies during a politically tumultuous period in British history. After studying at Oxford University, he was unable to graduate due to his refusal to take the oath of allegiance to the House of Hanover (which had replaced the Stuart dynasty). This political stance forced him to continue his mathematical work in Venice, Italy, before eventually returning to Scotland. Despite these obstacles, he produced groundbreaking work, including his masterpiece "Methodus Differentialis" (1730), which contained both the Stirling numbers and his famous approximation formula.

In addition to his purely mathematical contributions, Stirling worked as a mining engineer and helped establish the Glasgow Literary Society, demonstrating the breadth of his intellectual interests. His story illustrates how political circumstances could profoundly affect scientific careers even in the Enlightenment era, yet his mathematical legacy endured through the concepts and techniques that bear his name today.
