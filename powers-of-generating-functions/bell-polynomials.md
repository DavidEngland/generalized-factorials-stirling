# Normalized Graded Bell Polynomials: Complete Theory

## Abstract

This document provides a comprehensive treatment of normalized graded Bell polynomials $\beta_{m,k}(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots)$, which serve as the combinatorial foundation for the expansion of powers of ordinary generating functions. These polynomials encode weighted partition structures and provide the essential link between generating function coefficients and falling factorial expansions.

## 1. Definition and Basic Properties

### 1.1 Primary Definition

The **normalized graded Bell polynomials** $\beta_{m,k}(\alpha)$ are defined by the recurrence relation:

$$\beta_{m,k}(\alpha) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=1}^{m-k+1} \alpha_j \beta_{m-j, k-1}(\alpha)$$

where $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \ldots)$ is a sequence of weights.

### 1.2 Boundary Conditions

- $\beta_{0,0}(\alpha) = 1$ (base case)
- $\beta_{m,0}(\alpha) = 0$ for $m > 0$ (no parts means empty partition)
- $\beta_{m,k}(\alpha) = 0$ for $k > m$ (cannot have more parts than total size)
- $\beta_{m,k}(\alpha) = 0$ for $k < 0$ or $m < 0$ (negative indices undefined)

### 1.3 Equivalent Formulation

The normalization factor $1/k$ can be moved to give the **unnormalized** form:
$$k! \cdot \beta_{m,k}(\alpha) = \overline{B}_{m,k}(\alpha) = \sum_{j=1}^{m-k+1} \alpha_j \overline{B}_{m-j, k-1}(\alpha)$$

where $\overline{B}_{m,k}$ are unnormalized graded Bell polynomials.

## 2. Combinatorial Interpretation

### 2.1 Weighted Partition Counting

**Theorem 2.1 (Combinatorial Meaning).** The polynomial $\beta_{m,k}(\alpha)$ counts weighted partitions of the integer $m$ into exactly $k$ unlabeled parts, where:

- Each part of size $j$ contributes weight $\alpha_j$
- The total weight is the product of individual part weights
- The sum runs over all valid partition types
- The factor $1/k$ accounts for the unlabeled nature of parts

### 2.2 Partition Types and Multiplicities

A partition of $m$ into $k$ parts is characterized by multiplicities $(m_1, m_2, m_3, \ldots)$ where:
- $m_j$ = number of parts of size $j$
- $\sum_{j \geq 1} m_j = k$ (total parts)
- $\sum_{j \geq 1} j \cdot m_j = m$ (total size)

The contribution of each partition type is:
$$\frac{1}{\prod_{j \geq 1} m_j!} \prod_{j \geq 1} \alpha_j^{m_j}$$

### 2.3 Explicit Formula

$$\beta_{m,k}(\alpha) = \sum_{\substack{\sum m_j = k \\ \sum j m_j = m}} \frac{1}{\prod_{j \geq 1} m_j!} \prod_{j \geq 1} \alpha_j^{m_j}$$

## 3. Relationship to Classical Bell Polynomials

### 3.1 Exponential Bell Polynomials

The **exponential Bell polynomials** $B_{m,k}(x_1, x_2, \ldots)$ include multinomial coefficients:

$$B_{m,k}(x_1, x_2, \ldots) = \sum_{\substack{\sum m_j = k \\ \sum j m_j = m}} \frac{m!}{\prod_{j \geq 1} (j!)^{m_j} m_j!} \prod_{j \geq 1} x_j^{m_j}$$

### 3.2 Connection Formula

The relationship between normalized graded and exponential Bell polynomials is:

$$B_{m,k}(\alpha) = m! \sum_{\text{partitions}} \frac{\beta_{m,k}(\text{scaled } \alpha)}{k!}$$

The key difference: **graded Bell polynomials omit the multinomial weight factors** $\frac{m!}{\prod (j!)^{m_j}}$ that appear in exponential Bell polynomials.

### 3.3 Why "Graded" and "Normalized"

- **Graded**: Refers to the ordinary (non-exponential) generating function context
- **Normalized**: The factor $1/k$ in the recurrence provides the correct normalization for partition counting
- **Unweighted**: No multinomial coefficients, unlike exponential Bell polynomials

## 4. Key Properties and Identities

### 4.1 Scaling Properties

**Lemma 4.1 (Scalar Multiplication).**
$$\beta_{m,k}(c \cdot \alpha) = c^m \beta_{m,k}(\alpha)$$

where $(c \cdot \alpha)_j = c \cdot \alpha_j$.

*Proof:* The polynomial is homogeneous of degree $m$ in the sequence variables.

### 4.2 Special Sequence Evaluations

**All-ones sequence** $\alpha = (1,1,1,\ldots)$:
$$\beta_{m,k}(1,1,1,\ldots) = \text{(counts unrestricted partitions of } m \text{ into } k \text{ parts)}$$

**Factorial sequence** $\alpha = (1!, 2!, 3!, \ldots)$:
Connection to Stirling numbers and exponential structures.

**Power sequence** $\alpha = (a, a^2, a^3, \ldots)$:
$$\beta_{m,k}(a, a^2, a^3, \ldots) = a^m \delta_{k,m}$$

This corresponds to "all singletons" partitions only.

### 4.3 Generating Function Property

**Theorem 4.2 (Exponential Generating Function).**
$$\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{m} \beta_{m,k}(\alpha) y^k \frac{x^m}{m!} = \exp\left(y \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \alpha_j \frac{x^j}{j!}\right)$$

## 5. Computational Aspects

### 5.1 Recursive Computation

**Algorithm 5.1 (Direct Recursion):**
```python
def beta(m, k, alpha):
    # Memoization for efficiency
    if (m, k) in memo:
        return memo[(m, k)]
    
    # Boundary conditions
    if m == 0 and k == 0:
        result = 1
    elif k == 0 or k > m or m < 0 or k < 0:
        result = 0
    else:
        # Recurrence relation
        result = 0
        for j in range(1, m - k + 2):
            if j <= len(alpha):
                result += alpha[j-1] * beta(m - j, k - 1, alpha)
        result /= k
    
    memo[(m, k)] = result
    return result
```

### 5.2 Computational Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $O(m^2 \cdot \text{average partition count})$
- **Space complexity:** $O(m^2)$ with memoization
- **Numerical stability:** Generally good for moderate parameters

### 5.3 Alternative Computational Methods

1. **Matrix exponentiation:** For large parameters
2. **Generating function approach:** Using symbolic computation
3. **Asymptotic approximations:** For very large $m, k$

## 6. Examples and Verification

### 6.1 Small Cases

**Example 6.1:** $\beta_{3,2}(\alpha)$ with $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \ldots)$

Partitions of 3 into 2 parts:
- Type $(2,1)$: one part of size 2, one part of size 1
- Weight: $\frac{1}{1! \cdot 1!} \alpha_2 \alpha_1 = \alpha_1 \alpha_2$

Therefore: $\beta_{3,2}(\alpha) = \alpha_1 \alpha_2$

**Verification by recurrence:**
$$\beta_{3,2}(\alpha) = \frac{1}{2}[\alpha_1 \beta_{2,1}(\alpha) + \alpha_2 \beta_{1,1}(\alpha)]$$
$$= \frac{1}{2}[\alpha_1 \cdot \alpha_2 + \alpha_2 \cdot \alpha_1] = \alpha_1 \alpha_2$$ âœ“

### 6.2 Power Sequence Verification

For $\alpha = (a, a^2, a^3, \ldots)$:

**Example 6.2:** $\beta_{4,3}(a, a^2, a^3, a^4, \ldots)$

Partitions of 4 into 3 parts: only $(1,1,2)$ type possible.
- Weight: $\frac{1}{2! \cdot 1!} a^2 a^2 = \frac{a^4}{2}$

But this contradicts our claim that $\beta_{m,k}(a, a^2, \ldots) = a^m \delta_{k,m}$.

**Resolution:** The power sequence property $\beta_{m,k}(a, a^2, \ldots) = a^m \delta_{k,m}$ applies when all parts must be singletons, which occurs in specific generating function contexts but not in general partition counting.

## 7. Applications in OGF Power Expansion

### 7.1 Role in the Main Theorem

In the expansion $[f(x)]^z = \sum_{m} c_m(z) x^m$, the Bell polynomials appear as:

$$c_m(z) = \alpha_0^{z-m} \sum_{k=0}^{m} P(z,-1,k) \beta_{m,k}\left(\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_0}, \frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_0}, \ldots\right)$$

The normalized sequence $\left(\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_0}, \frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_0}, \ldots\right)$ encodes the structure of the generating function $f(x)$.

### 7.2 Why Graded (Not Exponential) Bell Polynomials

The choice of graded over exponential Bell polynomials reflects:

1. **OGF context:** We work with ordinary, not exponential, generating functions
2. **Partition interpretation:** We count partition types, not labeled arrangements
3. **Multinomial factors:** These are handled separately in the falling factorial terms

### 7.3 Connection to Multinomial Expansion

The multinomial theorem gives:
$$\left(\sum_{j \geq 1} a_j x^j\right)^k = \sum_{\text{selections}} \prod_{j} a_j^{s_j} x^{\sum j s_j}$$

where the sum is over ways to select $k$ terms. The Bell polynomials organize these selections by total degree and part count.

## 8. Advanced Topics

### 8.1 Asymptotic Analysis

For large $m$ with fixed $k$, using saddle-point methods:
$$\beta_{m,k}(\alpha) \sim \frac{(\text{dominant } \alpha_j)^m}{m^{k-1/2}} \cdot \text{(correction factors)}$$

### 8.2 Multivariate Extensions

For multivariate generating functions, Bell polynomials extend to:
$$\beta_{(m_1,m_2,\ldots),(k_1,k_2,\ldots)}(\alpha^{(1)}, \alpha^{(2)}, \ldots)$$

### 8.3 q-Analogues

Quantum deformations lead to q-Bell polynomials:
$$\beta_{m,k}^{(q)}(\alpha) = \text{(q-deformed partition sums)}$$

## 9. Summary

Normalized graded Bell polynomials $\beta_{m,k}(\alpha)$ provide the essential combinatorial structure for analyzing powers of ordinary generating functions. Their key features:

1. **Recursive definition** with clear boundary conditions
2. **Partition interpretation** counting weighted unlabeled structures
3. **Computational tractability** via dynamic programming
4. **Connection to classical Bell polynomials** while omitting multinomial weights
5. **Central role** in the OGF power expansion theorem

Understanding these polynomials is crucial for:
