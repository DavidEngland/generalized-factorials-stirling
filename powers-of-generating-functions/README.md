# Powers of Generating Functions: A Unified Framework

This folder contains a complete standalone project exploring the expansion of powers of ordinary generating functions $[f(x)]^z$ and their connections to falling factorial polynomials and normalized graded Bell polynomials.

## Overview

Given an ordinary generating function $f(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \alpha_m x^m$ with $f(0) = \alpha_0 \neq 0$, we investigate the expansion:

$$[f(x)]^z = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} c_m(z) x^m$$

The main result provides an explicit formula for the coefficients $c_m(z)$ in terms of:
- **Falling factorial polynomials** $P(z,-1,m)$
- **Normalized graded Bell polynomials** $\beta_{m,k}$
- **Generating function coefficients** $\alpha_m$

## Key Results

**Main Theorem (OGF Power Expansion):**
$$[x^m] [f(x)]^z = \alpha_0^{z-m} \sum_{k=0}^{m} P(z,-1,k) \beta_{m,k}\left(\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_0}, \frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_0}, \ldots\right)$$

This unifies coefficient extraction for OGF powers and reveals deep connections between combinatorics, special functions, and generating function theory.
