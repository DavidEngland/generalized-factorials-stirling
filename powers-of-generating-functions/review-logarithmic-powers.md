# Review of logarithmic-powers.md

This document provides a good overview of the properties of logarithmic generating function powers. Here are some suggestions for improvement, organized by section.

## General Comments

- **Consistency**: The document uses both `k` and `z` for the exponent. It would be clearer to use `k` when it's an integer and `z` for a general complex exponent, and to be consistent within sections.
- **Citations**: Some formulas are presented without derivation or citation (e.g., the Bell polynomial expansion). Adding references to a source document or a brief derivation would make the document more self-contained.

## Section 1: The OGF Structure of Logarithms

- **1.2 Interpretation of Coefficients**: The interpretations are a bit vague.
    - For `-\log(1-x)`, the coefficient `1/n` is more directly the weight of a cycle of length `n` in the "exponential formula" for permutations. The connection to the coupon collector's problem is valid but could be elaborated.
    - For `\log(1+x)`, the connection to inclusion-exclusion could be made more explicit, perhaps with a small example.

## Section 2: Powers of $-\log(1-x)$

- **2.1 Coefficient Analysis via Bell Polynomials**: The formula for `c_m(k)` seems to assume a theorem from another document. Since `f(0) = 0`, the standard formula for OGF powers needs to be adapted. The coefficient `c_m(k)` is more directly given by:
  $$c_m(k) = k! \cdot \beta_{m,k}\left(1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \ldots\right)$$
  This should be clarified. Also, the rising factorial `P(k,-1,j)` should be defined as `k(k+1)...(k+j-1)`.

- **2.3 Connection to Harmonic Numbers**: The formula for `[x^m][-\log(1-x)]^k` is correct, but it's also equal to `(k!/m!) * s(m,k)`, where `s(m,k)` are the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind. This is a more direct and fundamental connection that should be mentioned.

## Section 3: Powers of $\log(1+x)$

- **3.2 Relation to Stirling Numbers**: The formula is correct, but it might be better to write it as:
  $$[x^m][\log(1+x)]^k = \frac{k!}{m!} s(m,k)$$
  where `s(m,k)` are the signed Stirling numbers of the first kind. This avoids the `(-1)^{m-k}` term and uses the standard definition.

## Section 4: Connection to Special Functions

- **4.1 The Polygamma Connection**: The formula for `\mathcal{H}([\log(1+x)]^k)` is stated without proof. A brief sketch of the derivation, perhaps by applying the Hasse operator to the series expansion, would be beneficial.

- **4.2 Hurwitz Zeta Function Relationship**: The formula for `\mathcal{H}([\log(1+x)]^k)` in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function is quite complex. It might be helpful to show the derivation or at least verify it for `k=1`.

## Section 7: Powers of Polylogarithm Functions

- **7.2.1 Integer Values of s**: The formula for `[x^m][\text{Li}_2(x)]^2` is incorrect. The convolution of coefficients should be:
  $$[x^m][\text{Li}_2(x)]^2 = \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \frac{1}{j^2} \frac{1}{(m-j)^2}$$
  The term `2 * sum(1/(i^2*j))` does not belong here.

- **7.2.1 Integer Values of s**: The coefficient for `[\text{Li}_0(x)]^k` is `\binom{m-1}{k-1}`, not `\binom{m-1}{k-1} \binom{m}{k}`.

- **7.2.2 Non-Integer Values of s**: The formula for `p_m(s,k)` seems overly complex and may be incorrect. A simpler convolution approach is more standard.

- **7.4 Hasse Operator Applied to Polylogarithm Powers**: This is a very interesting and non-trivial claim. It would be valuable to provide a reference or a sketch of the proof, as this identity connects several advanced topics.
