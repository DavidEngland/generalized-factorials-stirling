# Powers of Logarithmic Generating Functions

## Introduction

This document examines the k-th powers of logarithmic functions as ordinary generating functions (OGFs), specifically focusing on:

1. $[\log(1+x)]^k$
2. $[\log\left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right)]^k = [-\log(1-x)]^k$

These cases provide fascinating connections between combinatorial structures, partition theory, and special functions including the polygamma functions and the Hurwitz zeta function.

## 1. The OGF Structure of Logarithms

### 1.1 Fundamental Series Expansions

The logarithmic functions have the following series representations:

$$-\log(1-x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n}$$

$$\log(1+x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}x^n}{n}$$

Thus, in terms of OGF coefficients:

**For $f(x) = -\log(1-x)$**:
- $\alpha_0 = 0$ (constant term)
- $\alpha_n = \frac{1}{n}$ for $n \geq 1$

**For $f(x) = \log(1+x)$**:
- $\alpha_0 = 0$ (constant term)
- $\alpha_n = \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}$ for $n \geq 1$

### 1.2 Interpretation of Coefficients

The coefficient $\frac{1}{n}$ in $-\log(1-x)$ represents the probability of drawing the first element at position $n$ in a random permutation, a connection to the *coupon collector's problem*.

The alternating coefficient $\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}$ in $\log(1+x)$ relates to the inclusion-exclusion principle in set partitioning problems.

## 2. Powers of $-\log(1-x)$

### 2.1 Coefficient Analysis via Bell Polynomials

For the k-th power $[-\log(1-x)]^k$, we aim to find:

$$[-\log(1-x)]^k = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} c_m(k) x^m$$

Using normalized graded Bell polynomials with the sequence $\alpha = (1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, ...)$:

$$c_m(k) = \sum_{j=0}^{m} P(k,-1,j) \beta_{m,j}(\alpha)$$

where $P(k,-1,j)$ is the rising factorial $(k|-1)^{\overline{j}}$.

### 2.2 Explicit Formula for Small Values

For $k=2$:
$$[-\log(1-x)]^2 = \sum_{m=2}^{\infty} \left(\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \frac{1}{j} \cdot \frac{1}{m-j}\right) x^m$$

For $k=3$:
$$[-\log(1-x)]^3 = \sum_{m=3}^{\infty} \left(\sum_{i,j,l \geq 1, i+j+l=m} \frac{1}{i \cdot j \cdot l}\right) x^m$$

These sums count weighted partitions where the weight of a partition is the product of reciprocals of the part sizes.

### 2.3 Connection to Harmonic Numbers

The coefficients can be expressed in terms of harmonic numbers and their generalizations:

$$[x^m][-\log(1-x)]^k = \frac{1}{(k-1)!} \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (-1)^j \binom{k-1}{j} H_{m+k-1-j}^{(1)}$$

where $H_n^{(1)}$ is the n-th harmonic number.

## 3. Powers of $\log(1+x)$

### 3.1 Coefficient Structure

For $[\log(1+x)]^k$, the alternating signs create a more complex pattern. The general form is:

$$[\log(1+x)]^k = \sum_{m=k}^{\infty} d_m(k) x^m$$

The coefficients $d_m(k)$ can be expressed through the Bell polynomial framework with the alternating sequence $\alpha = (1, -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, -\frac{1}{4}, ...)$.

### 3.2 Relation to Stirling Numbers

The coefficients of $[\log(1+x)]^k$ have a deep connection to unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind $s(m,k)$:

$$[x^m][\log(1+x)]^k = (-1)^{m-k} \frac{s(m,k)}{m!}$$

This relates to counting permutations of $m$ elements with exactly $k$ cycles.

### 3.3 Alternating Pattern Analysis

The coefficients exhibit an alternating pattern determined by $m-k$:

$$d_m(k) = (-1)^{m-k} \cdot |\text{coefficient value}|$$

This pattern arises from the interaction of the alternating signs in $\log(1+x)$ with the combinatorial structure of its powers.

## 4. Connection to Special Functions

### 4.1 The Polygamma Connection

The polygamma function of order $n$ is defined as:

$$\psi^{(n)}(x) = \frac{d^{n+1}}{dx^{n+1}}\log\Gamma(x)$$

For integer values of $k$, we can establish the relationship:

$$\mathcal{H}([\log(1+x)]^k) = (-1)^k \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} c_j \cdot \psi^{(j)}(x+1)$$

where $\mathcal{H}$ represents the Hasse operator and $c_j$ are specific constants.

### 4.2 Hurwitz Zeta Function Relationship

Using the identity $(s-1) \cdot \zeta(s,x) = \mathcal{H}(x^{1-s})$, we can bridge logarithmic powers and the Hurwitz zeta function.

For $[\log(1+x)]^k$, the Hurwitz zeta connection provides:

$$\mathcal{H}([\log(1+x)]^k) = (-1)^k k! \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \binom{k-1}{j} \frac{(-1)^j}{(k-j)!} \zeta(k-j+1,x+1)$$

### 4.3 Generating Function Perspective

From a generating function viewpoint:

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} [\log(1+x)]^k \frac{t^k}{k!} = (1+x)^t$$

This reveals the connection to the binomial series and provides another approach to coefficient extraction.

## 5. Computational Aspects

### 5.1 Recurrence Relations for Efficient Computation

For $[-\log(1-x)]^k$, coefficients satisfy:

$$c_m(k) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} c_j(k-1) \cdot c_{m-j}(1)$$

with base case $c_m(1) = \frac{1}{m}$ for $m \geq 1$.

### 5.2 Asymptotic Behavior

For large $m$ and fixed $k$:

$$[x^m][-\log(1-x)]^k \sim \frac{(\log m)^{k-1}}{(k-1)! \cdot m}$$

This asymptotic behavior connects to the statistics of random permutations and coupon collection.

## 6. Applications

- Waiting time distributions in sampling problems

### 6.2 Number Theory

In physics, these expansions relate to:

## 7. Powers of Polylogarithm Functions

The polylogarithm function, defined as $\text{Li}_s(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{z^k}{k^s}$, provides a natural generalization of our investigation into logarithmic powers, since $\text{Li}_1(z) = -\log(1-z)$.

### 7.1 General Structure of Polylogarithm Powers

For general $s$, the $k$-th power of the polylogarithm has the expansion:

$$[\text{Li}_s(x)]^k = \sum_{m=k}^{\infty} p_m(s,k) x^m$$

The coefficients $p_m(s,k)$ can be analyzed using the normalized graded Bell polynomials:

$$p_m(s,k) = \sum_{j=k}^{m} P(k,-1,j) \beta_{m,j}\left(\frac{1}{1^s}, \frac{1}{2^s}, \frac{1}{3^s}, \ldots\right)$$

This generalizes our previous results for logarithmic functions.

### 7.2 Special Cases and Their Significance

#### 7.2.1 Integer Values of $s$

For positive integer $s$, the powers $[\text{Li}_s(x)]^k$ relate to multiple zeta values and nested sums:

$$[x^m][\text{Li}_2(x)]^2 = \sum_{i+j=m, i,j \geq 1} \frac{1}{i^2 j^2} + 2\sum_{i+j=m, i,j \geq 1} \frac{1}{i^2 j}$$

For $s=0$, we get powers of the geometric series:

$$[\text{Li}_0(x)]^k = \left[\frac{x}{1-x}\right]^k$$

which connects to the negative binomial distribution and has coefficients:

$$[x^m][\text{Li}_0(x)]^k = \binom{m-1}{k-1} \binom{m}{k}$$

#### 7.2.2 Non-Integer Values of $s$

For non-integer $s$, the coefficients involve generalized harmonic numbers:

$$p_m(s,k) = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \binom{k}{j} (-1)^j \zeta(s,j+1) \cdot H_{m-j}^{(s)}$$

where $H_n^{(s)} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{i^s}$ is the generalized harmonic number and $\zeta(s,a)$ is the Hurwitz zeta function.

### 7.3 Multiple Polylogarithms and Nested Structures

The powers of polylogarithms naturally lead to multiple polylogarithms:

$$\text{Li}_{s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_k}(z) = \sum_{1 \leq n_1 < n_2 < \ldots < n_k} \frac{z^{n_k}}{n_1^{s_1} n_2^{s_2} \ldots n_k^{s_k}}$$

For example, certain coefficients in $[\text{Li}_s(x)]^2$ can be expressed in terms of $\text{Li}_{s,s}(x)$ and $\text{Li}_{2s}(x)$.

### 7.4 Hasse Operator Applied to Polylogarithm Powers

When the Hasse operator is applied to powers of polylogarithms:

$$\mathcal{H}([\text{Li}_s(x)]^k) = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} c_j(s,k) \zeta(s+j, x+1)$$

where the coefficients $c_j(s,k)$ involve binomial sums and factorial factors.

For $s=1$ (the logarithmic case), this reduces to our earlier polygamma connection.

### 7.5 Applications in Number Theory and Physics

Powers of polylogarithms appear in:

1. **Feynman integral calculations** in quantum field theory
2. **Analytic number theory**, particularly in the study of transcendental numbers
3. **Lattice sum evaluation** in statistical mechanics
4. **Modular forms** and their relationship to L-functions

The ability to expand these powers in terms of simpler special functions provides computational advantages in these fields.
