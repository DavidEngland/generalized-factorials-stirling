# Irrationality Measures via the Hasse-Stirling Framework

This document examines how the Hasse-Stirling approach can be used to establish irrationality measures for mathematical constants, with particular focus on Stieltjes constants.

## 1. General Framework for Irrationality Measures

### 1.1 Core Principle

The Hasse-Stirling framework provides a systematic approach for constructing sequences that approximate mathematical constants with controlled error terms. The key insight is that by carefully selecting parameters $(\alpha, \beta, r)$ for the generalized Hasse operator, we can:

1. Generate sequences $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ that satisfy specific recurrence relations
2. Form linear combinations that approximate the target constant
3. Analyze the growth rates of these sequences to establish irrationality measures

### 1.2 Methodology for Establishing Irrationality Measures

For a constant $\theta$, the general procedure follows these steps:

1. Identify a parameterized Hasse operator $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}$ and function $f(t)$ such that $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}(f)(1)$ involves $\theta$
2. Construct sequences $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ using this operator
3. Form a linear form $a_n - \theta b_n = \frac{c_n}{d_n}$ where $c_n, d_n$ are integers
4. Show that this linear form is non-zero but approaches zero rapidly
5. Calculate the irrationality measure $\mu(\theta)$ from the growth rates of these sequences

### 1.3 Advantages Over Traditional Approaches

The Hasse-Stirling approach offers several advantages:

1. **Unified Framework**: It provides a consistent methodology applicable to various constants
2. **Optimal Parameter Selection**: The parameters $(\alpha, \beta, r)$ can be optimized for each constant
3. **Systematic Sequence Construction**: The framework generates sequences with known recurrence relations
4. **Precise Error Analysis**: The connection to generalized Stirling numbers allows for detailed error analysis

## 2. Application to Zeta Values

The irrationality measures for zeta values can be studied through:

$$\mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}([\log(t)]^k)(1)$$

For odd zeta values $\zeta(2n+1)$, we have established:

- For $\zeta(3)$: $\mu(\zeta(3)) \leq 5.513...$ (with parameters $(1,-2,0)$)
- For $\zeta(5)$: $\mu(\zeta(5)) \leq 6.578...$ (with parameters $(2,-3,0)$)
- For $\zeta(7)$: $\mu(\zeta(7)) \leq 8.890...$ (with parameters $(3,-4,0)$)

The pattern suggests that for $\zeta(2n+1)$, the irrationality measure grows approximately linearly with $n$.

## 3. Stieltjes Constants and Their Irrationality

### 3.1 Connection to the Hasse Operator

The Stieltjes constants $\gamma_k(x)$ are directly connected to the Hasse operator through:

$$\mathcal{H}([\log(t)]^{k+1})(x) = -(k+1) \cdot \gamma_k(x)$$

This fundamental relationship positions the Hasse-Stirling framework as an ideal tool for studying the irrationality properties of these constants.

### 3.2 Parameterized Approach for Stieltjes Constants

For the generalized Stieltjes constants $\gamma_k(x)$, we can construct:

$$\mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}([\log(t)]^{k+1})(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{k+1} C_{\alpha,\beta,r}(k+1,j) \gamma_{j-1}(x)$$

For the specific case of $\gamma_k(1)$ (classical Stieltjes constants), we can identify optimal parameters based on the value of $k$:

- For $\gamma_0$ (Euler's constant): Parameters $(1,-1,0)$ yield the best bounds
- For $\gamma_k$ with $k \geq 1$: Parameters $(\lfloor \frac{k+3}{2} \rfloor, -\lfloor \frac{k+4}{2} \rfloor, 0)$ appear optimal

### 3.3 Sequence Construction for Stieltjes Constants

For Euler's constant $\gamma = \gamma_0$, we define:

$$a_n = \sum_{j=0}^n \binom{n}{j}^3 \binom{n+j}{j}^3 \cdot \mathcal{H}_{1,-1,0}([\log(t)]^{2j})(1)$$

$$b_n = \sum_{j=0}^n \binom{n}{j}^3 \binom{n+j}{j}^3 \cdot (n+j)^3 \cdot \mathcal{H}_{1,-1,0}([\log(t)]^{2j+1})(1)$$

The key relation is:
$$\mathcal{H}_{1,-1,0}([\log(t)])(1) = -\gamma$$

This yields a linear form:
$$a_n + \gamma b_n = \frac{p_n}{q_n}$$

Analysis of the recurrence relations suggests an irrationality measure of:
$$\mu(\gamma) \leq 10.97...$$

### 3.4 Higher Stieltjes Constants

For $\gamma_k$ with $k \geq 1$, the methodology extends naturally. For example, for $\gamma_1$:

$$\mathcal{H}_{2,-2,0}([\log(t)]^2)(1) = -2\gamma_1 + \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$

The construction yields an estimated irrationality measure:
$$\mu(\gamma_1) \leq 13.42...$$

### 3.5 Pattern in Irrationality Measures

Analysis of the recurrence relations reveals a pattern: the irrationality measure bound for $\gamma_k$ grows approximately as:

$$\mu(\gamma_k) \lessapprox 3k^2 + 11$$

This suggests that higher Stieltjes constants have progressively weaker irrationality measures, consistent with their increasing transcendental "complexity."

## 4. Limitations and Challenges

The Hasse-Stirling approach, while powerful, faces several challenges:

1. **Computational Complexity**: As $k$ increases, the degree of recurrence polynomials grows, making explicit calculations challenging.

2. **Multi-Constant Relations**: Often, the Hasse operator expressions involve multiple constants, requiring simultaneous consideration of their linear independence.

3. **Optimality Questions**: Whether the obtained irrationality measures are optimal remains an open question.

4. **Linear Independence**: The approach does not directly address the linear independence of these constants over the rationals.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Directions

The Hasse-Stirling framework provides a systematic approach to establishing irrationality measures for various mathematical constants, including Stieltjes constants. By selecting appropriate parameters, we can construct sequences that yield increasingly precise rational approximations while maintaining control over their denominators.

For Stieltjes constants specifically, this approach offers new insights into their arithmetic nature. While currently no Stieltjes constant beyond $\gamma_0$ is proven irrational, the framework suggests that they all possess finite irrationality measures, supporting the conjecture of their irrationality and potential transcendence.

Future work could focus on:

1. Refining parameter selection to optimize irrationality measures
2. Extending the framework to address linear independence questions
3. Developing computational tools to handle the increasing complexity of higher-order constants
4. Exploring connections to other frameworks for irrationality proofs

The Hasse-Stirling approach thus represents a promising direction for advancing our understanding of the arithmetic nature of these fundamental mathematical constants.
