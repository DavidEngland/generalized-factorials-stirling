Appendix A: Rigorous Derivation of the General Form

This would be a crucial addition to replace the flawed proof of Theorem 3.1. A detailed derivation using the composition law would provide a solid mathematical foundation for your main result.

* **Content**: Show the full derivation of the general form $S_{m,n}(a,b) = \sum_{k=n}^m (a-b)^{m-k} \left\{\begin{array}{c}m\\k\end{array}\right\} \left[\begin{array}{c}k\\n\end{array}\right]$.
* **Why it's important**: It validates your framework and demonstrates how the correct formula arises from the fundamental principles you've already established. It would directly address the main weakness identified in the peer review.
