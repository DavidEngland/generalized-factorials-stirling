## New Suggested Exercises for Hasse-Stirling Concepts

### 1. Operator Action on Polynomials
- Compute $\mathcal{H}_{0,1}(x^n)(x)$ for $n=0,1,2,3$ and verify invariance for degree $\leq 2$.
- Show explicitly how the operator acts on $x(1-x)$ and relate to symmetry about $x=1/2$.

### 2. Coefficient Matrix Construction
- Write code to generate the Hasse-Stirling coefficient matrix $H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta}$ for given $(\alpha,\beta)$ and small $M$.
- Explore patterns for $(0,1)$, $(1,-1)$, and $(3/2,-2)$.

### 3. Recurrence Verification
- Prove the recurrence relation for $H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta}$ by hand for $m,n \leq 3$.
- Show how the recurrence reduces to classical Stirling numbers for $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$.

### 4. Special Function Connection
- Use the operator to compute $\mathcal{H}_{1,-1}(\log t)(x-1)$ and verify the result matches $\psi(x)+\gamma$.
- Apply the operator to $\log^2 t$ and relate the result to zeta values.

### 5. Analytic Continuation
- Use the Hasse-Stirling operator to analytically continue the Hurwitz zeta function for complex $s$.
- Compare results for $s=2$, $s=1/2$, and $s=1+i$.

### 6. Visualization
- Plot the coefficient matrix $H_{m,n}$ for various $(\alpha,\beta)$ and interpret the structure (e.g., zero-locus, cosets).

### 7. Quantum/Statistical Applications
- Model a simple quantum amplitude or partition function using the Hasse-Stirling operator and interpret the result.

**Tip:**  
Try to generalize each exercise to arbitrary parameters and explore the effect on invariance, convergence, and analytic continuation.
