# Step-by-Step Guide: Analytic Continuation of Hurwitz Zeta via Hasse-Stirling Operator

## General Hasse-Stirling Recursion

The Hasse-Stirling coefficients $H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}$ are defined recursively:
$$
H_{m,n} = H_{m-1,n-1} - \frac{m\alpha + n\beta}{m+2} H_{m-1,n}
$$
with the initial (boundary) condition:
$$
H_{m,0} = \frac{1}{m+1}
$$
and $H_{0,0} = 1$.

---

## Goal

Use the Hasse-Stirling operator to analytically continue the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s, x)$ for complex $s$. Compare results for $s=2$, $s=1/2$, and $s=1+i$.

---

## Step 1: Recall the Hurwitz Zeta Definition

The Hurwitz zeta function is defined for $\Re(s) > 1$ as:
$$
\zeta(s, x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(n+x)^s}
$$
where $x > 0$.

---

## Step 2: Hasse-Stirling Operator Setup

The Hasse-Stirling operator for analytic continuation is:
$$
\mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}(f)(x) = \sum_{m=0}^\infty \sum_{n=0}^m H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} (x+n)^{1-\alpha-\beta+n} f^{(n)}(x+n)
$$

For Hurwitz zeta, set:
- $f(t) = t^{-s}$
- $(\alpha, \beta, r) = (1, 0, 0)$

---

## Step 3: Operator Action for Hurwitz Zeta

The operator gives:
$$
\mathcal{H}_{1,0,0}(t^{-s})(x) = \zeta(s, x) - \frac{x^{1-s}}{s-1}
$$
So,
$$
\zeta(s, x) = \mathcal{H}_{1,0,0}(t^{-s})(x) + \frac{x^{1-s}}{s-1}
$$

## Step 4: Compute the Operator for Specific $s$

### (a) $s=2$

- Compute $f(t) = t^{-2}$
- Compute derivatives $f^{(n)}(t)$ (student: work out $f^{(n)}(t)$ for $n=0,1,2$)
- Use the recurrence for $H_{m,n}^{1,0,0}$ (student: write out $H_{m,n}$ for small $m,n$ using the recursion and initial condition above)
- Plug into the operator formula for a few terms (student: evaluate for $x=1$)

### (b) $s=1/2$

- Compute $f(t) = t^{-1/2}$
- Compute derivatives $f^{(n)}(t)$ (student: use the general formula for derivatives of $t^{-s}$)
- Use $H_{m,n}^{1,0,0}$ as above
- Evaluate the sum for $x=1$ (student: compare convergence and analytic continuation)

### (c) $s=1+i$

- Compute $f(t) = t^{-(1+i)}$
- Compute derivatives $f^{(n)}(t)$ (student: recall the formula for derivatives of $t^{-s}$ for complex $s$)
- Use $H_{m,n}^{1,0,0}$ as above
- Evaluate for $x=1$ (student: note the complex values and analytic continuation)

---

## Step 5: Compare Results

- For each $s$, compare the value from the operator expansion to the classical series (where convergent).
- Discuss how the operator allows analytic continuation for $\Re(s) \leq 1$ and complex $s$.
- Note the role of the correction term $\frac{x^{1-s}}{s-1}$.

---

## Step 6: Student Tasks

- Explicitly compute $f^{(n)}(t)$ for $t^{-s}$ for $n=0,1,2$.
- Write out $H_{m,n}^{1,0,0}$ for $m,n=0,1,2$ using the recursion and initial condition.
- Evaluate the first few terms of the operator sum for $x=1$ and each $s$.
- Compare with direct numerical evaluation of $\zeta(s,1)$.
- Reflect on how the Hasse-Stirling operator enables analytic continuation for complex $s$.

**Hint:**  
For $f^{(n)}(t) = (-1)^n \frac{\Gamma(s+n)}{\Gamma(s)} t^{-s-n}$.

**Summary:**  
This guide is self-contained: it provides the general recursion, initial condition, and step-by-step instructions for using the Hasse-Stirling operator to analytically continue the Hurwitz zeta function for complex $s$. Work through the explicit calculations for $s=2$, $s=1/2$, and $s=1+i$ to see the power of the operator method.

## Example Student Solution (Proofread, Structured, and Graded)

### Step 1: General Setup and Operator

- **Recursion for $(\alpha,\beta,r)=(1,0,0)$:**
  $$
  H_{m,n} = H_{m-1,n-1} - \frac{m}{m+2} H_{m-1,n}
  $$
  with $H_{m,0} = \frac{1}{m+1}$, $H_{0,0}=1$.

- **Operator Formula:**
  $$
  \mathcal{H}_{1,0,0}(t^{-s})(x) = \sum_{m=0}^\infty \sum_{n=0}^m H_{m,n} (x+n)^{n} f^{(n)}(x+n)
  $$
  and
  $$
  \zeta(s,x) = \mathcal{H}_{1,0,0}(t^{-s})(x) + \frac{x^{1-s}}{s-1}
  $$

### Step 2: Student Tasks

#### 1. Compute $f^{(n)}(t)$ for $f(t) = t^{-s}$

- $f^{(n)}(t) = (-1)^n \frac{\Gamma(s+n)}{\Gamma(s)} t^{-s-n}$
- For $n=0$: $t^{-s}$
- For $n=1$: $-s t^{-s-1}$
- For $n=2$: $s(s+1) t^{-s-2}$

#### 2. Write out $H_{m,n}$ for $m,n=0,1,2$

- $H_{0,0} = 1$
- $H_{1,0} = 1/2$, $H_{1,1} = 1/2$
- $H_{2,0} = 1/3$, $H_{2,1} = 1/3$, $H_{2,2} = 1/3$

#### 3. Evaluate the first few terms for $x=1$

For $s=2$:
- $f^{(0)}(2) = 1/1^2 = 1$
- $f^{(1)}(2) = -2/2^3 = -1/4$
- $f^{(2)}(2) = 6/2^4 = 3/8$

Plug into the operator sum for $m=0,1,2$ and $n=0,1,2$ using $H_{m,n}$ above.

#### 4. Compare with direct numerical evaluation

- For $s=2$: $\zeta(2) = \pi^2/6 \approx 1.6449$
- For $s=1/2$: $\zeta(1/2) \approx -1.46035$
- For $s=1+i$: $\zeta(1+i) \approx 0.00330 + 0.70425i$

#### 5. Reflection

- The operator sum provides analytic continuation for complex $s$.
- The correction term isolates the pole at $s=1$.
- The operator sum is entire in $s$.
