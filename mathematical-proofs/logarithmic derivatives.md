# Logarithmic Derivatives and Stirling Numbers

The connection between logarithmic derivatives and Stirling numbers emerges naturally:

$$\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\log f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1}(k-1)! \cdot S(n,k) \cdot \frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{f(x)^k}$$

where $S(n,k)$ are the Stirling numbers of the first kind.

## Proof Outline

To verify this identity, follow these steps:

1. **Base Case**: Verify the formula for $n=1$:
   - $\frac{d}{dx}\log f(x) = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}$
   - Note that $S(1,1) = 1$

2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the formula holds for $n$. Differentiate both sides with respect to $x$:
   - Left side: $\frac{d^{n+1}}{dx^{n+1}}\log f(x)$
   - Right side: Differentiate each term in the sum
   
3. **Hint**: When differentiating $\frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{f(x)^k}$, use the quotient rule:
   - $\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{f(x)^k}\right) = \frac{f^{(k+1)}(x)f(x) - k f^{(k)}(x)f'(x)}{f(x)^{k+1}}$
   - Rearrange to get $\frac{f^{(k+1)}(x)}{f(x)^{k+1}} - k \frac{f^{(k)}(x)f'(x)}{f(x)^{k+1}}$

4. **Key Step**: After differentiating, you'll get:
   - Terms with $\frac{f^{(k+1)}(x)}{f(x)^{k+1}}$
   - Terms with $\frac{f^{(k)}(x)f'(x)}{f(x)^{k+1}}$
   
5. **Recombining**: Show that these terms can be recombined using the recurrence relation for Stirling numbers:
   - $S(n+1,k) = S(n,k-1) - n S(n,k)$
   
6. **Verification**: Check that the coefficients match to complete the proof.

**Exercise**: Fill in the details of steps 3-6 to complete the proof.

## Alternative Approach Using Generating Functions

Another elegant approach uses exponential generating functions:

1. Consider the exponential generating function for $\log(1+x)$:
   - $\log(1+x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1}\frac{x^n}{n}$
   
2. For a general function $f(x)$, apply the chain rule for formal power series.

3. Use the connection between the formal derivatives of $\log(1+x)$ and the Stirling cycle numbers.

**Challenge**: Complete this alternative proof and compare its elegance with the direct approach.

## Bell Polynomial Approach Using Faà di Bruno's Formula

A third powerful approach uses Bell polynomials and the Faà di Bruno formula for derivatives of composite functions:

1. **Starting Point**: Express $\log f(x)$ as a composition $\log \circ f$.

2. **Faà di Bruno's Formula**: For the $n$-th derivative of a composition $h \circ g$:
   - $(h \circ g)^{(n)}(x) = \sum_{k=1}^n h^{(k)}(g(x)) \cdot B_{n,k}(g'(x), g''(x), \ldots, g^{(n-k+1)}(x))$
   - Where $B_{n,k}$ are the Bell polynomials

3. **Special Case for Logarithm**: When $h(x) = \log(x)$, we have:
   - $h^{(k)}(x) = (-1)^{k-1}(k-1)! \cdot x^{-k}$

4. **Key Insight**: Substituting into Faà di Bruno's formula:
   - $\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\log f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1}(k-1)! \cdot f(x)^{-k} \cdot B_{n,k}(f'(x), f''(x), \ldots, f^{(n-k+1)}(x))$

5. **Connection to Stirling Numbers**: The complete Bell polynomials are related to Stirling numbers of the first kind:
   - $B_{n,k}(1!, 2!, 3!, \ldots, (n-k+1)!) = s(n,k) \cdot n!$
   - Where $s(n,k)$ are the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind

6. **Special Lemma**: For the case where $f(x) = g(x) \cdot f'(x)$, the Bell polynomials simplify in a particularly elegant way:
   - $B_{n,k}(f'(x), f''(x), \ldots, f^{(n-k+1)}(x)) = \binom{n-1}{k-1} \cdot (f'(x))^k \cdot (f(x))^{n-k}$

7. **Verification**: Combine the previous steps to show that:
   - $\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\log f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1}(k-1)! \cdot \frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{f(x)^k}$
   - And prove that the coefficients indeed match the Stirling numbers of the first kind

**Exercise**: Derive the explicit formula for the Bell polynomials when $f(x) = g(x) \cdot f'(x)$ and show how this connects to the Stirling number formula.

**Historical Note**: The Faà di Bruno formula is named after Francesco Faà di Bruno (1825-1888), an Italian mathematician and priest who was canonized as a saint in 1988. The formula itself had appeared earlier in the work of Louis François Antoine Arbogast (1759-1803), but Faà di Bruno provided a more systematic treatment.
