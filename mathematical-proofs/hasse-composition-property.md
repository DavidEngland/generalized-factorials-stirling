# Compositional Properties of the Hasse Operator

This document examines compositional properties of the Hasse operator and corrects common misconceptions.

## 1. Prerequisites and Notation

Let's establish the key definitions and notation:

- The Hasse shift operator $\mathcal{H}$ is defined as $\mathcal{H}(f)(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \mathcal{H}_m(f)(x)$
- Each partial operator $\mathcal{H}_m$ is defined as $\mathcal{H}_m(f)(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{m} H_{m,n} f(x+n)$
- The Hasse coefficients are $H_{m,n} = \frac{(-1)^n \binom{m}{n}}{m+1}$
- We use $(f \circ g)(x)$ to denote the composition $f(g(x))$

## 2. Clarifying a Common Misconception

A common misconception is to assume that the Hasse operator satisfies the compositional property:

$$\mathcal{H}(f \circ g) = (\mathcal{H}f) \circ (\mathcal{H}g)$$

However, this identity is **not generally true** for the Hasse operator. Similarly, the related claim:

$$\mathcal{H}([g(x)]^n) = [\mathcal{H}(g)(x)]^n$$

is also incorrect in general. We can demonstrate this with a simple counter-example.

## 3. Counter-Example: Failure of the Compositional Property

Let's consider $g(x) = x^2$. 

First, we compute $\mathcal{H}(g)(x)$:
$$\mathcal{H}(x^2) = \frac{1}{3}x^2 - \frac{2}{3}(x+1)^2 + \frac{1}{3}(x+2)^2$$
$$= \frac{1}{3}x^2 - \frac{2}{3}(x^2+2x+1) + \frac{1}{3}(x^2+4x+4)$$
$$= \frac{1}{3}x^2 - \frac{2}{3}x^2 - \frac{4}{3}x - \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3}x^2 + \frac{4}{3}x + \frac{4}{3}$$
$$= \frac{2}{3}$$

So $[\mathcal{H}(g)(x)]^2 = (\frac{2}{3})^2 = \frac{4}{9}$.

Now, let's compute $\mathcal{H}([g(x)]^2) = \mathcal{H}(x^4)$:
$$\mathcal{H}(x^4) = \frac{1}{5}x^4 - \frac{4}{5}(x+1)^4 + \frac{6}{5}(x+2)^4 - \frac{4}{5}(x+3)^4 + \frac{1}{5}(x+4)^4$$

Expanding this would yield a complicated polynomial, clearly not equal to the constant $\frac{4}{9}$. This proves that $\mathcal{H}([g(x)]^n) \neq [\mathcal{H}(g)(x)]^n$ in general.

## 4. The Correct Framework: Delta Operators and Formal Group Laws

The Hasse operator is actually a **delta operator** - a linear operator that reduces the degree of a polynomial by exactly one when applied to powers of $x$. Delta operators have specific compositional properties that are more complex than the simple form initially suggested.

### 4.1 Delta Operators and Their Properties

A delta operator $D$ is characterized by:
- $D(1) = 0$
- $D(x) = c \neq 0$ (typically normalized so $c = 1$)
- $D$ reduces degree by exactly 1 when applied to powers of $x$

The Hasse operator is a delta operator, but it is not translation-invariant (unlike the standard derivative).

### 4.2 Connection to Formal Group Laws

The compositional properties of the Hasse operator are best understood through formal group laws. For a formal group law $F(x,y) = \sum_{m,n} c_{m,n} x^m y^n$, there exists a logarithm $\log_F(x)$ such that:

$$F(\log_F(x), \log_F(y)) = \log_F(x+y)$$

The Hasse operator is related to the logarithm of a specific formal group law. Its action on exponential generating functions is particularly revealing:

$$\mathcal{H}(e^{tx})(x) = \frac{t \cdot e^{tx}}{e^t - 1}$$

This is directly connected to the exponential generating function of Bernoulli polynomials.

## 5. The Actual Compositional Properties

While the simple compositional formula is incorrect, the Hasse operator does have important compositional properties:

1. **Action on Bernoulli Polynomials**: The Hasse operator maps powers of $x$ to Bernoulli polynomials:
   $$\mathcal{H}(x^n)(x) = \frac{B_n(x)}{n!}$$

2. **Relation to Forward Difference**: If $\Delta$ is the forward difference operator, then:
   $$\mathcal{H}_m = \frac{1}{m+1} \sum_{k=0}^{m} (-1)^k \binom{m}{k} E^k$$
   where $E$ is the shift operator.

3. **Action on Generating Functions**: For analytic functions with power series representation, the Hasse operator provides a transformation to the Bernoulli basis.

## 6. Conclusion

The compositional property $\mathcal{H}(f \circ g) = (\mathcal{H}f) \circ (\mathcal{H}g)$ is generally false for the Hasse operator. The correct understanding of the Hasse operator's behavior requires the more sophisticated framework of delta operators and formal group laws.

This more complex structure actually makes the Hasse operator more powerful and interesting, as it connects to deep mathematical structures in umbral calculus, number theory, and combinatorics.

On the other hand:
- $(\mathcal{H}f) \circ (\mathcal{H}g)(x) = \frac{a \cdot e^{a \cdot b(x-\frac{1}{2})}}{e^a - 1} = \frac{a \cdot e^{abx} \cdot e^{-\frac{ab}{2}}}{e^a - 1}$

For this to equal $\mathcal{H}(f \circ g)(x)$, we would need:
$\frac{ab}{e^{ab} - 1} = \frac{a \cdot e^{-\frac{ab}{2}}}{e^a - 1}$

This doesn't hold generally, showing that the compositional property has restrictions. It holds in special cases, particularly when dealing with certain classes of functions in umbral calculus.

## 5. Conclusion

The compositional property $\mathcal{H}(f \circ g) = (\mathcal{H}f) \circ (\mathcal{H}g)$ holds under the framework of umbral calculus with specific conditions on $f$ and $g$. The key requirement is that $g(0) = 0$ and both functions can be represented as appropriate power series.

This property is particularly useful in symbolic computation involving the Hasse operator, as it allows for simplification of nested applications and connects to the broader theory of umbral calculus and formal group laws.
