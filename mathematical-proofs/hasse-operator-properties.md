# Notable Properties of the Hasse Operator

While the compositional properties of the Hasse operator are more complex than initially thought, this operator possesses numerous other fascinating properties that make it valuable in various mathematical contexts.

## 1. Basic Definitions

The full Hasse shift operator $\mathcal{H}$ is defined as:

$$\mathcal{H}(f)(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \mathcal{H}_m(f)(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \sum_{n=0}^{m} H_{m,n} f(x+n)$$

where the Hasse coefficients are:

$$H_{m,n} = \frac{(-1)^n \binom{m}{n}}{m+1}$$

## 2. Annihilation and Identity Properties

1. **Constant Annihilation**: For any constant $c$, $\mathcal{H}_m(c) = 0$ for all $m \geq 1$.

2. **Identity on Constants**: The full operator preserves constants: $\mathcal{H}(c) = c$.

3. **Polynomial Degree Reduction**: When applied to powers of $x$, $\mathcal{H}_m(x^n) = 0$ for $m > n$.

## 3. Connection to Bernoulli Polynomials

One of the most profound properties is the direct connection to Bernoulli polynomials:

$$\mathcal{H}(x^n)(x) = \frac{B_n(x)}{n!} \text{ for } n \geq 1$$

where $B_n(x)$ are the Bernoulli polynomials. This provides a computational path from powers to Bernoulli polynomials.

## 4. Generating Function Transformations

The Hasse operator transforms generating functions in remarkable ways:

1. **Exponential Functions**: 
   $$\mathcal{H}(e^{tx})(x) = \frac{t \cdot e^{tx}}{e^t - 1}$$

2. **Logarithmic Functions**:
   $$\mathcal{H}([\log(t)]^k)(x) = -k \cdot \gamma_{k-1}(x)$$
   where $\gamma_{k-1}(x)$ is the $(k-1)$-th generalized Stieltjes constant.

3. **Rational Functions**:
   $$\mathcal{H}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)(x) \text{ relates to the digamma function } \psi(x)$$

## 5. Integral Representation

The Hasse operator can be represented as an integral:

$$\mathcal{H}(f)(x) = \int_0^1 f(x-t) \, dB_1(t)$$

where $B_1(t)$ is the first Bernoulli polynomial and the integration is understood in the Stieltjes sense.

## 6. Fixed Points and Eigenfunctions

The Hasse operator has interesting fixed points and eigenfunctions:

1. **Fixed Points**: Functions satisfying $\mathcal{H}(f) = f$ are related to solutions of certain functional equations. The constant functions $f(x) = c$ are the most obvious fixed points.

2. **Eigenfunction Properties**: There exist functions $f$ such that $\mathcal{H}(f) = \lambda f$ for some constant $\lambda$.

3. **Invariant Function Classes**: Beyond constants, the Hasse operator maps certain special function classes onto themselves:
   
   - **Bernoulli-Exponential Functions**: Functions of the form $f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n \frac{B_n(x)}{n!}$ with specific coefficient constraints.
   
   - **Periodic Functions with Period 1**: Functions satisfying $f(x+1) = f(x)$ that are expressible as Fourier series have special behavior under the Hasse operator. If $f(x) = \sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} c_k e^{2\pi i k x}$, then $\mathcal{H}(f)$ is again a function with period 1.
   
   - **Rational Functions with Specific Pole Structure**: Certain rational functions whose poles align with the natural numbers can be mapped to functions of the same class.
   
   - **Hurwitz Zeta-Type Functions**: Functions related to the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s,x)$ form an invariant class under specific transformations involving the Hasse operator.

4. **Fixed Point Equation**: The functional equation characterizing fixed points of the Hasse operator is:

   $$f(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \sum_{n=0}^{m} H_{m,n} f(x+n)$$
   
   This equation has been studied in relation to fractal functions and iterative functional equations.

## 7. Series Acceleration

The Hasse operator can accelerate the convergence of certain series:

$$\mathcal{H}\left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n x^n\right) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \frac{B_n(x)}{n!}$$

For some slowly converging series, this transformation can lead to more rapidly convergent representations.

## 8. Commutation Relations

The Hasse operator has interesting commutation relations with other operators:

1. **Differentiation**: $\mathcal{H} \circ \frac{d}{dx} \neq \frac{d}{dx} \circ \mathcal{H}$ in general, but they satisfy specific commutation relations.

2. **Shift Operators**: If $E_a$ is the shift operator $E_a f(x) = f(x+a)$, then $\mathcal{H} \circ E_a \neq E_a \circ \mathcal{H}$, but the commutator has a specific form.

## 9. Invariant Subspaces

Certain function spaces are invariant under the Hasse operator:

1. **Polynomial Spaces**: The space of polynomials of degree $\leq n$ is invariant under the operator.

2. **Analytic Function Spaces**: The Hasse operator maps certain classes of analytic functions to themselves.

3. **Rational Function Spaces**: The space of rational functions with poles at non-positive integers is mapped to itself.

4. **Quasi-Polynomial Spaces**: Functions of the form $p(x)e^{\alpha x}$ where $p(x)$ is a polynomial and $\alpha$ is a constant form an invariant space.

5. **Dirichlet Series**: Functions expressible as Dirichlet series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{n^s}$ form an invariant class under certain conditions.

6. **Laurent Series**: Functions with Laurent series expansions around specific points can be transformed in a structured way by the Hasse operator.

## 10. Connection to Finite Differences and Shift Operators

The Hasse operator has deep connections to the calculus of finite differences, providing a bridge between continuous and discrete mathematics.

### 10.1 Representation via Shift Operators

The Hasse operator can be expressed in terms of the shift operator $E$ where $E^k f(x) = f(x+k)$:

$$\mathcal{H}_m = \frac{1}{m+1} \sum_{k=0}^{m} (-1)^k \binom{m}{k} E^k$$

This representation reveals the Hasse operator as a weighted sum of shifts, with weights determined by binomial coefficients and alternating signs.

### 10.2 Connection to Finite Difference Operators

The forward difference operator $\Delta$ is defined as $\Delta f(x) = f(x+1) - f(x) = (E-I)f(x)$, where $I$ is the identity operator. Higher-order differences are defined recursively: $\Delta^n = \Delta(\Delta^{n-1})$.

The Hasse operator relates to these finite differences through:

$$\mathcal{H}_m = \frac{1}{m+1} \sum_{j=0}^{m} s(m,j) \frac{\Delta^j}{j!}$$

where $s(m,j)$ are the Stirling numbers of the first kind. This reveals the Hasse operator as a specific combination of finite difference operators of various orders.

### 10.3 Newton Series and Hasse Operator

The Newton series of a function is:

$$f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \binom{x}{k} \Delta^k f(0)$$

When the Hasse operator is applied to this series, we get:

$$\mathcal{H}(f)(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{B_k(x)}{k!} \Delta^k f(0)$$

This transforms the Newton series into a series involving Bernoulli polynomials.

### 10.4 Divided Differences and the Hasse Operator

The Hasse operator also connects to divided differences. For a function $f$, the divided difference $f[x_0,x_1,...,x_n]$ is defined recursively:

$$f[x_0] = f(x_0)$$
$$f[x_0,x_1,...,x_n] = \frac{f[x_1,...,x_n] - f[x_0,...,x_{n-1}]}{x_n-x_0}$$

The Hasse operator relates to these as:

$$\mathcal{H}_m(f)(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{m} \frac{H_{m,n}}{n!} \cdot n! \cdot f[x,x+1,...,x+n]$$

### 10.5 Examples and Identities

1. **Action on Powers**: For $f(x) = x^n$, the Hasse operator gives:
   $$\mathcal{H}_m(x^n) = \frac{1}{m+1} \sum_{k=0}^{m} (-1)^k \binom{m}{k} (x+k)^n$$
   
   For $m > n$, this equals zero, showing the degree-lowering property of the operator.

2. **Newton Forward Difference Formula**: The relationship to the forward difference formula is:
   $$\mathcal{H}_m(f)(x) = \frac{1}{m+1} \sum_{k=0}^{m} (-1)^k \binom{m}{k} \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \binom{k}{j} \Delta^j f(x)$$

3. **Iterated Differences**: Applying the Hasse operator $\mathcal{H}_m$ to differences gives interesting identities:
   $$\mathcal{H}_m(\Delta^n f)(x) = \Delta^n(\mathcal{H}_m f)(x + n)$$
   for specific values of $m$ and $n$.

### 10.6 Applications in Numerical Analysis

The connection between the Hasse operator and finite differences provides powerful tools for:

1. **Interpolation**: Creating interpolation formulas based on Bernoulli polynomials rather than Newton polynomials.

2. **Quadrature**: Developing numerical integration schemes with improved error properties.

3. **Differential Equations**: Solving differential equations by transforming them into difference equations.

4. **Summation Formulas**: Deriving Euler-Maclaurin type summation formulas with different error characteristics.

These connections demonstrate how the Hasse operator serves as a fundamental link between continuous calculus and the calculus of finite differences, providing new perspectives on both.

## 11. Combinatorial Interpretations

The Hasse coefficients $H_{m,n}$ have combinatorial interpretations:

1. **Weighted Partitions**: They count certain weighted partitions in combinatorial structures.

2. **Lattice Path Counting**: They relate to counting specific types of lattice paths.

## 12. Umbral Calculus Framework

Within umbral calculus, the Hasse operator has additional properties:

1. **Sheffer Sequence**: The operator generates Sheffer sequences related to Bernoulli polynomials.

2. **Umbral Composition**: While normal composition fails, umbral composition provides a rich framework for understanding the operator's behavior.

## Conclusion

The Hasse operator, despite not satisfying simple compositional properties, possesses a wealth of other remarkable properties that make it a powerful tool in mathematical analysis, number theory, and combinatorics. Its connections to special functions, particularly Bernoulli polynomials and Stieltjes constants, demonstrate its profound significance in mathematics.
