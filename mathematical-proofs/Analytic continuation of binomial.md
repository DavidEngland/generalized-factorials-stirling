 Bi(s,t) is the product of (t+n)(s-t+n)/(s+n)/n over all natural numbers n.

---

## Differential of $\log(\mathrm{Bi}(s,t))$

Let
\[
\mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(t+n)(s-t+n)}{(s+n)n}
\]

Taking logarithms,
\[
\log \mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left[ \log(t+n) + \log(s-t+n) - \log(s+n) - \log n \right]
\]

### Total Differential

\[
d\,\log \mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(
\frac{dt}{t+n}
+ \frac{ds - dt}{s-t+n}
- \frac{ds}{s+n}
\right)
\]

### Partial Derivatives

- **With respect to $s$:**
  \[
  \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \log \mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(
  \frac{1}{s-t+n}
  - \frac{1}{s+n}
  \right)
  \]

- **With respect to $t$:**
  \[
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \log \mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(
  \frac{1}{t+n}
  - \frac{1}{s-t+n}
  \right)
  \]

### Connection to the Digamma Function

Recall that
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{z+n} = \psi(1) - \psi(z+1)
\]
where $\psi(z)$ is the digamma function.

Therefore, the partial derivatives can be written as:

- **With respect to $s$:**
  \[
  \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \log \mathrm{Bi}(s,t)
  = \psi(s-t+1) - \psi(s+1)
  \]

- **With respect to $t$:**
  \[
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \log \mathrm{Bi}(s,t)
  = \psi(t+1) - \psi(s-t+1)
  \]

---

### Combined Full Expression for the Differential

The total differential of $\log \mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ is:
\[
d\,\log \mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \left[ \psi(s-t+1) - \psi(s+1) \right] ds + \left[ \psi(t+1) - \psi(s-t+1) \right] dt
\]

Therefore, the differential of $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ itself is:
\[
d\,\mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \mathrm{Bi}(s,t) \left( \left[ \psi(s-t+1) - \psi(s+1) \right] ds + \left[ \psi(t+1) - \psi(s-t+1) \right] dt \right )
\]

### Interpretation

- The differential of $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ is proportional to itself, with the proportionality given by a linear combination of digamma function differences.
- This structure is reminiscent of the logarithmic derivative of special functions (e.g., Gamma, Beta), and encodes how $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ changes under infinitesimal variations of $s$ and $t$.
- The analytic properties and singularities of $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ are governed by the poles and behavior of the digamma functions in the expression above.

## Analytic Structure and Special Values of $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$

### Poles and Zeros

- **Poles:**
  The digamma function $\psi(z)$ has poles at $z=0,-1,-2,\ldots$.
  Thus, $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ has poles when $t = -n$, $s-t = -n$, or $s = -n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, i.e. at non-positive integer values of $t$, $s-t$, or $s$.

- **Zeros:**
  Zeros occur when the numerator vanishes, i.e. $t = -n$ or $s-t = -n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, but these are also poles of the denominator, so zeros and poles may cancel or reinforce depending on the order.

### Special Values

- **$\mathrm{Bi}(s,s)$:**
  Substitute $t = s$:
  \[
  \mathrm{Bi}(s,s) = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(s+n)(0+n)}{(s+n)n} = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n}{n} = 1
  \]
  So $\mathrm{Bi}(s,s) = 1$ for all $s$.

- **$\mathrm{Bi}(s,0)$:**
  Substitute $t = 0$:
  \[
  \mathrm{Bi}(s,0) = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n(s+n)}{(s+n)n} = 1
  \]
  So $\mathrm{Bi}(s,0) = 1$ for all $s$.

### Boundary Conditions

- **At $t=0$ or $t=s$:**
  $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = 1$ (see above).
- **At $s=0$:**
  \[
  \mathrm{Bi}(0,t) = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(t+n)(-t+n)}{n^2}
  \]
  This is generally not $1$ and may have zeros or poles depending on $t$.

### Behavior on Integer Lattice Quadrants

- **For $s,t \in \mathbb{N}$:**
  The product is finite for $n > \max(s,t)$, so $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ is a rational function of $s$ and $t$.
- **Quadrant $s>t>0$:**
  All terms are positive, so $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t) > 0$.
- **Quadrant $t>s>0$:**
  $s-t+n$ can be negative for small $n$, leading to sign changes or poles.
- **Quadrant $s<0$ or $t<0$:**
  Poles and zeros can occur due to negative arguments in the product.

### Summary Table

| Case           | Value/Behavior                |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| $t=0$          | $\mathrm{Bi}(s,0) = 1$       |
| $t=s$          | $\mathrm{Bi}(s,s) = 1$       |
| $s=0$          | $\mathrm{Bi}(0,t)$: product over $(t+n)(-t+n)/n^2$ |
| $s,t \in \mathbb{N}$ | Rational, positive if $s>t>0$ |
| Poles          | $t=-n$, $s-t=-n$, $s=-n$     |
| Zeros          | Coincide with poles, may cancel |

---

**Implications:**
$\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ is regular and equals $1$ on the boundaries $t=0$ and $t=s$. Its analytic structure is governed by the poles of the digamma function, and its sign and magnitude depend on the quadrant and integer values of $s$ and $t$.

## Discrete Recurrence Relation on the Positive Integer Lattice

For $s, t \in \mathbb{N}$, $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ satisfies the recurrence:
\[
\mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \mathrm{Bi}(s-1,t) + \mathrm{Bi}(s-1,t-1)
\]

**Sketch of Proof:**

- On the positive integer lattice, the infinite product defining $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ truncates to a finite product for $n > \max(s,t)$.
- The recurrence is analogous to Pascal's rule for binomial coefficients, and can be checked directly for small $s, t$ by expanding the product.
- The structure of the product implies that incrementing $s` by $1$ splits the terms into two contributions: one with $t$ unchanged, one with $t$ decremented.

**Implication:**
$\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ behaves like a generalized binomial coefficient on the integer lattice, satisfying a simple additive recurrence relation.

---

## Binomial-Like Behavior and Explicit Formula

Given the recurrence and boundary conditions, $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ behaves like a binomial coefficient on the integer lattice. In fact, for $s, t \in \mathbb{N}$ with $0 \leq t \leq s$:

\[
\mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \frac{s!}{t!\,(s-t)!}
\]

Therefore,
\[
\frac{\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)}{s!} = \frac{1}{t!\,(s-t)!}
\]

This matches the binomial coefficient formula and extends naturally since $1/s!$ is an entire function over the complex plane.

**Implication:**
$\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ generalizes the binomial coefficient and, when normalized by $s!$, yields a product of reciprocal factorials, which is well-behaved and analytic for complex $s$ and $t$ (away from poles).

---

## Complex and Imaginary Arguments for $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$

- The infinite product and digamma representations for $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ are analytic wherever the arguments avoid the poles of the denominator, i.e., $s \neq -n$, $t \neq -n$, $s-t \neq -n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- For complex or purely imaginary $s$ and $t$, $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ can be computed using the same formulas:
  - The infinite product converges for $\Re(s) > -1$, $\Re(t) > -1$, $\Re(s-t) > -1$.
  - The digamma function $\psi(z)$ is defined for all complex $z$ except non-positive integers.

- **Examples:**
  - For $s = i\alpha$, $t = i\beta$ ($\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$), $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ is well-defined and generally complex-valued, except at the poles.
  - For generic complex $s, t$, $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ is analytic except where the denominator vanishes.

- **Analytic Continuation:**
  - The factorials in the binomial formula can be replaced by Gamma functions for complex arguments:
    \[
    \mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \frac{\Gamma(s+1)}{\Gamma(t+1)\,\Gamma(s-t+1)}
    \]
    valid for $s, t \in \mathbb{C}$, $t, s-t \notin \{-1, -2, \ldots\}$.

**Implication:**
$\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ is well-defined and analytic for complex and imaginary $s, t$ except at the poles of the Gamma/digamma functions. This allows extension to the complex plane, with rich analytic structure and applications in complex analysis and special functions.

---

## Evaluating the Gamma Function for Imaginary or Complex Values

- The Gamma function $\Gamma(z)$ is defined for all complex $z$ except non-positive integers, where it has simple poles.
- For complex or imaginary arguments, $\Gamma(z)$ can be evaluated using:
  - **Integral representation:**
    \[
    \Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t} dt
    \]
    valid for $\Re(z) > 0$, and extended by analytic continuation elsewhere.
  - **Reflection formula:**
    \[
    \Gamma(z)\Gamma(1-z) = \frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi z)}
    \]
    useful for relating values at $z$ and $1-z$.
  - **Recurrence relation:**
    \[
    \Gamma(z+1) = z\,\Gamma(z)
    \]
    allows computation for arbitrary $z$.
  - **Numerical methods:**
    Most mathematical software (e.g., Python's `scipy.special.gamma`, Mathematica, MATLAB) can compute $\Gamma(z)$ for complex $z$.

- For purely imaginary $z = i\alpha$, $\Gamma(i\alpha)$ is generally complex-valued and can be computed numerically or via the above formulas.

**Summary:**
To evaluate $\Gamma(z)$ for complex or imaginary $z$, use the integral, recurrence, or reflection formulas, or rely on standard mathematical libraries for numerical computation. The function is analytic except at its poles.

## Weierstrass Product for $1/\Gamma(s)$ and $1/s!$

The Weierstrass product for the reciprocal Gamma function is:
\[
\frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} = s\, e^{\gamma s} \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1 + \frac{s}{n}\right) e^{-s/n}
\]

To get $1/s!$, divide by $s$:
\[
\frac{1}{s!} = \frac{1}{s\,\Gamma(s)} = e^{\gamma s} \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1 + \frac{s}{n}\right) e^{-s/n}
\]

## Recovering $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ from Factorials

Given
\[
\mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \frac{s!}{t!\,(s-t)!}
\]
and using the analytic continuation for complex $s$ and $t$:
\[
\mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{s!}} \cdot \frac{1}{t!} \cdot \frac{1}{(s-t)!}
\]
or equivalently,
\[
\mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \frac{\Gamma(s+1)}{\Gamma(t+1)\,\Gamma(s-t+1)}
\]

**Implication:**
The Weierstrass product for $1/\Gamma(s)$, divided by $s$, gives $1/s!$, and the product formula for $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ follows directly from the ratio of these analytic continuations. This connects the infinite product, factorial, and binomial structures for both integer and complex arguments.

## Computing $\exp(\gamma)$ and $\exp(-\gamma)$

- Eulerâ€“Mascheroni constant $\gamma \approx 0.5772$ is transcendental and appears in many analytic formulas.
- $\exp(\gamma)$ and $\exp(-\gamma)$ are transcendental numbers.
- Series representation:
  \[
  \gamma = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} - \log n \right)
  \]
  so
  \[
  \exp(\gamma) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \exp\left( \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} - \log n \right)
  \]
- Alternatively, since $\gamma = -\psi(1)$ (where $\psi$ is the digamma function):
  \[
  \exp(-\gamma) = \exp(\psi(1))
  \]
- As an exponential generating function (EGF), $\exp(\gamma)$ does not have a simple closed EGF, but can be approximated numerically or via the above series.

**Summary:**
$\exp(\gamma)$ and $\exp(-\gamma)$ are transcendental and can be computed numerically, or expressed as $\exp(-\psi(1))$. For analytic work, use the digamma relation for convenience.

---

## Asymptotic Expansion and Neat Expressions for $\exp(\gamma)$

- The Eulerâ€“Mascheroni constant $\gamma$ is transcendental and does not have a simple closed form in terms of elementary functions.
- However, $\exp(\gamma)$ can be expressed using infinite products and limits, and has connections to $\pi$ and other constants.

### Asymptotic Expansion for $\psi(z)$ (Digamma Function)

For large $z$:
\[
\psi(z) \sim \log z - \frac{1}{2z} - \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{B_{2k}}{2k\,z^{2k}}
\]
where $B_{2k}$ are Bernoulli numbers.

Thus,
\[
\exp(\psi(z)) \sim z \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2z} - \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{B_{2k}}{2k\,z^{2k}}\right)
\]

### Neat Expressions for $\exp(\gamma)$

- **Infinite Product:**
  \[
  \exp(\gamma) = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left( \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right) e^{-1/n} \right)
  \]
- **Limit Representation:**
  \[
  \exp(\gamma) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{\log n} \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k}\right) e^{-1/k}
  \]
- **Connection to $\pi$ and Sine:**
  Using the reflection formula for Gamma:
  \[
  \Gamma(z)\Gamma(1-z) = \frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi z)}
  \]
  but $\exp(\gamma)$ itself does not have a direct simple relation to $\pi$.

- **Numerical Value:**
  \[
  \exp(\gamma) \approx 1.781072417990197985236504103107
  \]

### Summary

- $\exp(\gamma)$ is transcendental and most neatly expressed via infinite products or limits.
- Asymptotic expansions for $\exp(\psi(z))$ are available for large $z$.
- No simple closed form in terms of $\pi$ or elementary functions is known.

**Implication:**
For analytic work, use the infinite product or limit representations for $\exp(\gamma)$, and asymptotic expansions for $\exp(\psi(z))$ as needed. These forms are well-suited for both theoretical and numerical applications.

## Analytic Continuation and Rational Arguments via Digamma Differences

Yes, you can use the differential of $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ and Gauss's digamma theorem to move between rational arguments.

- **Gauss's digamma theorem** provides explicit values for $\psi(p/q)$ for rational $p/q$.
- The differential
  \[
  d\,\mathrm{Bi}(s,t) = \mathrm{Bi}(s,t) \left( [\psi(s-t+1) - \psi(s+1)]\,ds + [\psi(t+1) - \psi(s-t+1)]\,dt \right)
  \]
  allows analytic continuation from known values at rational points to nearby points (e.g., $a/b \to a/b+1$, $c/d \to c/d-1$), as long as you avoid the poles.

- **Procedure:**
  - Start at a rational $(s,t)$ where $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ is known.
  - Use the differential and explicit digamma values to increment or decrement $s$ or $t$ by rational steps.
  - Integrate along paths in the $(s,t)$ plane, avoiding non-positive integer poles.

**Implication:**
This method lets you systematically compute $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ at rational and nearby complex values, leveraging the explicit digamma values and the differential structure. It provides a practical approach for analytic continuation and evaluation across the complex plane.

---

### Geometric and Arithmetic Interpretation of the Differential

- The differential of $\log \mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ involves differences of digamma functions, which encode harmonic sums when $s$ and $t$ are integers:
  \[
  \psi(n+1) = -\gamma + \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}
  \]
  so the differential relates to changes in partial sums of reciprocals (harmonic numbers).

- At rational points, Gauss's digamma theorem expresses $\psi(p/q)$ in terms of logarithms and cotangent sums:
  \[
  \psi\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = -\gamma - \log q - \frac{\pi}{2} \cot\left(\frac{\pi p}{q}\right) + \sum_{k=1}^{q-1} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k p}{q}\right) \log\left(2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi k}{q}\right)\right)
  \]
  so the differential at rational arguments involves cotangent and logarithmic terms.

- **Geometric meaning:**
  The differential describes how $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ changes under infinitesimal shifts in $s$ and $t$, with the digamma differences acting as a "vector field" in the $(s,t)$ plane. On the integer lattice, this corresponds to discrete steps in harmonic sums; at rational points, it encodes more subtle arithmetic and trigonometric structure.

**Summary:**
The differential of $\log \mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ connects to harmonic sums on the integer lattice, cotangent/logarithmic expressions at rationals (via Gauss's theorem), and geometrically represents the local rate of change of $\mathrm{Bi}(s,t)$ in the $(s,t)$ plane, governed by the analytic properties of the digamma function.
