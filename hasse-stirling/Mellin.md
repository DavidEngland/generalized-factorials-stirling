# Mellin and Laplace Transforms in the Hasse-Stirling Framework

The Hasse-Stirling numbers are rooted in finite difference calculus, but their true power lies in the **analytic continuation** of special functions—especially the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s, a)$—where integral transforms like **Mellin** and **Laplace** play a central role.

## 1. Mellin Transform Connection

The Mellin transform is directly connected to generalized zeta functions:

\[
\Gamma(s) \zeta(s, a) = \int_0^\infty t^{s-1} \frac{e^{-a t}}{1 - e^{-t}} dt
\]

This integral is the Mellin transform of $f(t) = \frac{e^{-a t}}{1 - e^{-t}}$, providing a fundamental **integral representation** for $\zeta(s, a)$ and enabling analytic continuation.

- **Role of Mellin:** The Mellin transform gives the analytic continuation and functional equations for $\zeta(s, a)$.
- **Hasse-Stirling Link:** Hasse-Stirling numbers provide the coefficients for the **Euler-Maclaurin summation formula**, which also achieves analytic continuation for $\zeta(s, a)$. Mellin and Hasse-Stirling are complementary: one is continuous (integral), the other discrete (summation).

## 2. Laplace Transform Connection

The Laplace transform is closely related to the Mellin transform (via $t = e^{-u}$ change of variables).

The Hurwitz zeta function is not the Laplace transform of a simple function, but its series is derived from Laplace transforms of $\frac{1}{(n+a)^s}$:

\[
\frac{1}{(n+a)^s} = \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} \int_0^\infty t^{s-1} e^{-(n+a)t} dt
\]

Summing over $n$:

\[
\zeta(s, a) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(n+a)^s} = \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} \int_0^\infty t^{s-1} e^{-a t} \left( \sum_{n=0}^\infty e^{-n t} \right) dt
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} \int_0^\infty t^{s-1} \frac{e^{-a t}}{1 - e^{-t}} dt
\]

This is the same as the Mellin transform integral above.

- **Role of Laplace:** The Laplace kernel ($e^{-pt}$) is the source of the integral representation for $\frac{1}{x^s}$ via the Gamma function, foundational for zeta function analysis.

## 3. Two Paths to Analytic Continuation

Both Hasse-Stirling (discrete summation) and Mellin/Laplace (integral transforms) provide analytic continuation for $\zeta(s, a)$:

| Method           | Mathematical Core                        | Output                        | Connection to $\zeta(s, a)$                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Hasse-Stirling   | Finite Differences, Bernoulli Polynomials| Euler-Maclaurin coefficients  | Finite sum plus analytic error integral    |
| Mellin Transform | Integral Transform, Gamma Function       | Integral representation       | Valid for $\Re(s)>1$ and analytic continuation |

Both approaches are foundational in analytic number theory, especially for understanding zeta functions at negative integers, where $\zeta(1-n, a)$ relates to Bernoulli polynomials $B_n(a)$, whose coefficients Hasse-Stirling numbers generalize.

## 4. Inverse Mellin and Laplace Transforms: Hasse-Stirling Perspective

The **inverse Mellin transform** (and similarly, the inverse Laplace transform) reconstructs a function from its transform, typically via a contour integral in the complex plane:

\[
f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c - i\infty}^{c + i\infty} F(s) t^{-s} ds
\]

where $F(s)$ is the Mellin transform of $f(t)$.

### Hasse-Stirling Analogy

- The **inverse Hasse-Stirling transform** has a similar structure to the forward transform, but with sign changes in the parameters (see the inverse coefficients in the cheatsheet).
- For the discrete case, the inverse Hasse operator reconstructs the original function from its Hasse-Stirling expansion:
  \[
  f(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \sum_{n=0}^{m} I_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta} g_m(x-n)
  \]
  where $I_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta}$ are the inverse Hasse coefficients, typically involving $(-\alpha, -\beta)$.

### Connection to Inverse Mellin/Laplace (Without Gamma Factor)

- The Mellin transform for $\zeta(s, a)$ includes a $\Gamma(s)$ factor, which complicates direct inversion.
- If we consider the Mellin transform **without the gamma factor**, i.e., focus on the kernel $t^{s-1} \frac{e^{-a t}}{1 - e^{-t}}$, the structure resembles the Hasse-Stirling expansion, where the coefficients encode discrete corrections.
- The inverse Hasse-Stirling transform, with sign-reversed parameters, can be interpreted as a discrete analogue of the inverse Mellin/Laplace transform, reconstructing the original function from its expansion coefficients.

### Practical Implication

- For functions expressible as a Hasse-Stirling series (e.g., via Euler-Maclaurin correction terms), the inverse Hasse-Stirling transform provides a way to recover the original function, analogous to how the inverse Mellin or Laplace transform recovers $f(t)$ from $F(s)$.
- This is especially useful for the "non-gamma" part of the transform, where the discrete structure matches the Hasse-Stirling framework.

### Summary Table

| Transform         | Forward Form                        | Inverse Form (Hasse-Stirling)         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Mellin/Laplace    | $F(s) = \int_0^\infty f(t) t^{s-1} dt$ | $f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int F(s) t^{-s} ds$ |
| Hasse-Stirling    | $g_m(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{m} H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta} f(x+n)$ | $f(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \sum_{n=0}^{m} I_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta} g_m(x-n)$ |

**Conclusion:**  
- The inverse Hasse-Stirling transform is a discrete analogue of the inverse Mellin/Laplace transform, especially for the part of the expansion not involving the gamma function.
- Both approaches reconstruct the original function from its expansion coefficients, with the Hasse-Stirling method using sign-reversed parameters.
