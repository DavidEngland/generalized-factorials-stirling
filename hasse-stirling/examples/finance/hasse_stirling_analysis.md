# Hasse-Stirling Method Performance Analysis

## Observed Performance Issues

If the Hasse-Stirling method didn't demonstrate significant speed advantages or showed higher error rates in the benchmarks, there are several important factors to consider:

### 1. Specialized Application Domain

The Hasse-Stirling approach provides its greatest advantages in specific scenarios:

- **Deep Out-of-the-Money Options**: When S/K < 0.8
- **Deep In-the-Money Options**: When S/K > 1.2
- **Very Low or High Volatility**: When σ < 0.1 or σ > 0.5
- **Long-Dated Options**: When T > 1 year

**Standard market conditions** (ATM options with normal volatility) don't stress numerical methods enough to show significant differences.

### 2. Implementation Considerations

Our current implementation may have limitations:

- **Overhead Costs**: The additional function calls in the hypergeometric implementation could negate theoretical efficiency gains
- **Recurrence Relations**: Optimal use of recurrence relations may not be fully implemented
- **Error Handling**: Excessive fallbacks to standard methods may reduce apparent benefits

### 3. Benchmark Representativeness

The benchmarks may not represent cases where Hasse-Stirling excels:

- **Real Market Data**: The options data we fetched likely consists of mostly ATM and near-ATM options
- **Sample Size**: Limited sample size may not cover extreme cases
- **Regular Market Conditions**: Current market conditions may not include high volatility scenarios

## Optimization Opportunities

To improve the Hasse-Stirling implementation:

### 1. Parameter Optimization

```python
# Current implementation
def hypergeometric_2f1_hasse(a, b, c, z, max_m=30):
    # ...existing code...
```

**Recommended changes**:
- Reduce `max_m` for standard cases (10-15 is often sufficient)
- Increase `max_m` only for extreme cases
- Implement adaptive parameter selection based on option characteristics

### 2. Domain-Specific Optimizations

```python
# Current implementation 
if volatility_time < 0.05 or volatility_time > 5 or abs(np.log(S/K)) > 3:
    # Use Hasse-Stirling
else:
    # Use standard approach
```

**Recommended changes**:
- Refine the decision criteria for when to use each method
- Create a more granular decision tree based on moneyness and volatility
- Implement a hybrid approach that uses different parts of each method

### 3. Precomputation

For repeated calculations with similar parameters, precompute and store Hasse coefficients:

```python
# Store coefficients by parameter set
_hasse_coefficient_cache = {}

def get_hasse_coefficients(alpha, beta, r, max_m):
    key = (alpha, beta, r, max_m)
    if key not in _hasse_coefficient_cache:
        _hasse_coefficient_cache[key] = compute_hasse_coefficients(max_m, alpha, beta, r)
    return _hasse_coefficient_cache[key]
```

## When to Expect Significant Advantages

The Hasse-Stirling approach should demonstrate clear advantages in:

### 1. Exotic Option Pricing

Exotic options often involve:
- Multiple exercise dates
- Path dependencies
- Complex payoff structures

These require many more function evaluations, making computational efficiency critical.

### 2. Risk Management Calculations

Risk metrics like:
- Greeks (delta, gamma, vega)
- Value-at-Risk (VaR)
- Expected Shortfall

Require repeated option pricing across different scenarios, amplifying any performance gains.

### 3. Calibration Problems

Model calibration involves:
- Solving inverse problems
- Iterative optimization
- Many function evaluations

The Hasse-Stirling approach can significantly reduce calibration time.

## Theoretical vs. Practical Implementation

It's important to note that theoretical advantages don't always translate directly to practical implementation benefits:

1. **Computational Complexity**: While the theoretical complexity may be lower, constant factors matter in practice

2. **Memory Usage**: More efficient algorithms sometimes use more memory, creating different bottlenecks

3. **Hardware Optimization**: Standard methods may benefit from extensive hardware optimization (SIMD instructions, etc.)

## Suggested Next Steps

1. **Focused Benchmarking**: Create synthetic extreme cases to better demonstrate advantages

2. **Implementation Refinement**: Optimize the core Hasse-Stirling implementation for performance

3. **Expanded Use Cases**: Test on exotic options and portfolio calculations where repeated evaluations are needed

4. **Parallel Implementation**: Develop GPU-accelerated versions where the Hasse-Stirling approach's parallelizability can shine
