# Hurwitz Zeta Function Evaluation Strategy

This guide outlines a practical routine for evaluating the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s, x)$, leveraging the Hasse-Stirling framework where optimal, and switching to alternative methods in other regimes.

---

## 1. Hasse-Stirling Regime (Hyperbolic Strip)

**Best for:**  
- $s$ in the "hyperbolic strip" (typically $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 0$ and $|\operatorname{Im}(s)|$ not too large)
- $x > 0$ (avoiding singularities at $x=0$)

**Routine:**
1. **Set $s = a + b i$** (with $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$).
2. **Choose parameters:**  
   - $\alpha, \beta, r$ as needed (often $\alpha=0$, $\beta=1$, $r=0$ for classical case).
3. **Compute:**  
   $$
   S = \mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}(x^{1-s}) = \sum_{m=0}^{M} \sum_{n=0}^{m} H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} (x+n)^{1-s}
   $$
   where $M$ is the truncation order.
4. **Divide by $(s-1)$:**  
   $$
   \zeta(s, x) = \frac{S}{s-1}
   $$
5. **Error control:**  
   - Increase $M$ until the last term is below desired tolerance.

**Notes:**  
- For $s$ near $1$, use analytic continuation or series acceleration.
- For large $|\operatorname{Im}(s)|$, convergence may slow; consider alternative methods.

---

## 2. Critical Strip and Other Regimes

**Best for:**  
- $0 < \operatorname{Re}(s) < 1$ (critical strip)
- Large $|\operatorname{Im}(s)|$
- $x$ near $0$

**Alternative Methods:**
- **Euler-Maclaurin Summation:**  
  Use for $s$ near the critical line or when Hasse-Stirling converges slowly.
- **Integral Representations:**  
  For $x > 0$, use:
  $$
  \zeta(s, x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} \int_0^\infty \frac{t^{s-1} e^{-x t}}{1 - e^{-t}} dt
  $$
- **Specialized Algorithms:**  
  Use mpmath, scipy, or other libraries for high-precision or challenging domains.

## 3. Practical Usage Example

```python
# Pseudocode for Hurwitz zeta evaluation

def hurwitz_zeta(s, x, alpha=0, beta=1, r=0, M=30, tol=1e-12):
    # Compute Hasse-Stirling coefficients H_{m,n}^{alpha,beta,r}
    # For each m in 0..M, n in 0..m:
    #   S += H_{m,n} * (x + n)**(1 - s)
    # Stop when last term < tol
    # Return S / (s - 1)
    pass

# For s in hyperbolic strip, use above routine
# For s in critical strip, use scipy.special.zeta or mpmath.zeta
```

## 5. Evaluation of $1/\zeta(s)$ in the Critical Strip

Evaluating $1/\zeta(s)$ within the critical strip ($0 < \operatorname{Re}(s) < 1$) is a classic problem in analytic number theory.

### Number-Theoretic Representation

- For $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$:
  $$
  \frac{1}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}
  $$
  where $\mu(n)$ is the Möbius function.

- For $0 < \operatorname{Re}(s) < 1$ (critical strip), this Dirichlet series diverges, but analytic continuation is possible via Stieltjes-type expansions.

### Stieltjes Expansion

- The reciprocal zeta function can be expanded as:
  $$
  \frac{1}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \eta_k (s-1)^k
  $$
  where $\eta_k$ are Stieltjes constants for $1/\zeta(s)$, analogous to the expansion for $\zeta(s)$.

### Hasse-Stirling Perspective

- The Hasse-Stirling framework can be used to accelerate or regularize the computation of $1/\zeta(s)$ in the critical strip by:
  - Applying the operator to the Möbius Dirichlet series for $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$ and analytically continuing via Euler-Maclaurin or Stieltjes expansions.
  - Using the operator to compute Stieltjes constants for $1/\zeta(s)$, similar to its use for $\zeta(s)$ and $\gamma_k$.

### Practical Approach

- For $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$, use the Möbius Dirichlet series.
- For $0 < \operatorname{Re}(s) < 1$, use analytic continuation:
  - Expand $1/\zeta(s)$ in a Stieltjes-type series around $s=1$.
  - Use Hasse-Stirling to compute the coefficients $\eta_k$ if possible.

**Summary Table Update:**

| Regime                        | Method for $1/\zeta(s)$         | Notes                                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$    | Möbius Dirichlet series          | Fast convergence, use direct sum       |
| $0 < \operatorname{Re}(s) < 1$| Stieltjes expansion / analytic continuation | Use Hasse-Stirling for coefficients    |
| Large $|\operatorname{Im}(s)|$| Integral / Lib                   | Use analytic continuation              |

**Tip:**  
- For $1/\zeta(s)$ in the critical strip, treat as a Stieltjes-type problem.
- Use Hasse-Stirling to compute or accelerate the coefficients in the expansion.

## 6. Exponential Generating Function for $((s-1)\zeta(s,x))^{-1}$ at $s=1$

The function $((s-1)\zeta(s,x))^{-1}$, evaluated at $s=1$, is closely related to the exponential generating function (EGF) for the reciprocal of the Hurwitz zeta's analytic continuation.

### EGF Connection

- Recall: $(s-1)\zeta(s,x)$ is the generating function for generalized Bernoulli polynomials.
- Its reciprocal, $((s-1)\zeta(s,x))^{-1}$, at $s=1$, can be interpreted as the EGF for a sequence related to the Möbius function and Stieltjes-type constants.

### Explicit Form

At $s=1$:
\[
((s-1)\zeta(s,x))^{-1}\Big|_{s=1} = \left( \lim_{s \to 1} (s-1)\zeta(s,x) \right)^{-1}
\]
But $\lim_{s \to 1} (s-1)\zeta(s,x) = 1$, so the reciprocal is $1$.

For the EGF, consider the expansion around $s=1$:
\[
(s-1)\zeta(s,x) = 1 - \gamma_0(x)(s-1) + \gamma_1(x)(s-1)^2 - \cdots
\]
So its reciprocal is:
\[
((s-1)\zeta(s,x))^{-1} = 1 + \eta_1(x)(s-1) + \eta_2(x)(s-1)^2 + \cdots
\]
where the $\eta_k(x)$ are generalized Stieltjes constants for the reciprocal.

### EGF Representation

The exponential generating function for $\eta_k(x)$ is:
\[
G(t;x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \eta_k(x) \frac{t^k}{k!}
\]
This $G(t;x)$ encodes the coefficients for the reciprocal expansion and can be studied via the Hasse-Stirling framework.

### Hasse-Stirling Perspective

- The Hasse-Stirling operator can be used to compute the $\eta_k(x)$ coefficients by acting on suitable logarithmic or reciprocal functions.
- This provides a discrete analogue to the EGF for the reciprocal zeta expansion.

**Summary:**  
- $((s-1)\zeta(s,x))^{-1}$ at $s=1$ is $1$, but its expansion coefficients $\eta_k(x)$ form an EGF that can be accessed via Hasse-Stirling methods.
- This connects the reciprocal zeta function, Möbius inversion, and Stieltjes constants in a unified generating function framework.

## 7. Functions Corresponding to Reciprocal Stieltjes Coefficients via Hasse-Stirling

The coefficients $\eta_k(x)$ in the expansion of $((s-1)\zeta(s,x))^{-1}$ (the reciprocal Stieltjes constants) can be interpreted as Hasse-Stirling transforms of specific functions or powers of functions, analogous to how the classical Stieltjes constants $\gamma_k(x)$ arise from powers of $\log(t)$.

### Classical Case

- **Stieltjes constants $\gamma_k(x)$:**  
  $$
  \gamma_k(x) = -\frac{1}{k+1} \mathcal{H}_{\frac{k+3}{2},-\frac{k+4}{2},0}([\log(t)]^{k+1})(x)
  $$
  (Hasse-Stirling operator acting on powers of $\log(t)$.)

### Reciprocal Case

- **Reciprocal Stieltjes coefficients $\eta_k(x)$:**  
  These correspond to the Hasse-Stirling operator acting on powers of a function $g(t)$ such that:
  $$
  \eta_k(x) = \mathcal{H}_{\alpha_k',\beta_k',r'}([g(t)]^{k+1})(x)
  $$
  where $g(t)$ is the functional inverse (in a generating function sense) of $\log(t)$, or more generally, the function whose expansion matches the reciprocal series.

#### Candidate Functions

- **Inverse Logarithm:**  
  Powers of $1/\log(t)$ or related functions may generate the reciprocal coefficients.
- **Exponential or Möbius-Weighted Functions:**  
  Functions involving Möbius inversion, such as $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(n) t^n / n$, or Dirichlet generating functions for $1/\zeta(s)$.
- **Combinatorial Inverse Series:**  
  The reciprocal expansion can sometimes be represented as a Hasse-Stirling transform of a combinatorial inverse, e.g., via Lagrange inversion or series reversion.

#### General Principle

- For each family of coefficients (Stieltjes, reciprocal Stieltjes, etc.), there exists a function $f(t)$ (or power thereof) such that:
  $$
  \text{Coefficient}_k(x) = \mathcal{H}_{\alpha_k,\beta_k,r}([f(t)]^{k+1})(x)
  $$
  with parameters chosen to optimize convergence and match the analytic structure.

### Relation to Bernoulli Numbers, Polynomials, and Lambert Series

- The classical Stieltjes constants $\gamma_k(x)$ are closely related to generalized Bernoulli polynomials, since $(s-1)\zeta(s,x)$ is the generating function for these polynomials.
- The reciprocal coefficients $\eta_k(x)$, arising from $((s-1)\zeta(s,x))^{-1}$, do **not** correspond directly to Bernoulli numbers or polynomials.
- **Lambert Series:** While Lambert series are deeply connected to Dirichlet series and Möbius inversion, they do not directly yield the reciprocal Stieltjes coefficients or a simple generating function for $((s-1)\zeta(s,x))^{-1}$. The Lambert series for the Möbius function,
  $$
  \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(n) \frac{q^n}{1 - q^n}
  $$
  is related to $1/\zeta(s)$ for $q = e^{-s}$, but does not provide a direct link to Bernoulli numbers or the reciprocal expansion coefficients $\eta_k(x)$.
- Instead, the reciprocal coefficients are associated with the combinatorial or Dirichlet inverse of the Bernoulli generating function, and may be interpreted as "reciprocal Bernoulli-type" sequences, but **not** the classical Bernoulli numbers or polynomials themselves.

**Summary:**  
- Stieltjes constants $\gamma_k(x)$: Related to generalized Bernoulli polynomials via Hasse-Stirling on powers of $\log(t)$.
- Reciprocal coefficients $\eta_k(x)$: Not directly related to Bernoulli numbers/polynomials or Lambert series; instead, they arise from the reciprocal expansion and may be viewed as a combinatorial inverse sequence.

### Bell Polynomials and Series Expansions for Reciprocal Logarithms

You can use **Bell polynomials** to expand functions like $1/\log(1+x)$, $1/\log(t)$, or $\log(t)^{-s}$ in series form. The Bell polynomials $B_n$ provide the coefficients for the expansion of composite functions, especially for powers and reciprocals of logarithms.

#### Example Expansions

- For $1/\log(1+x)$:
  $$
  \frac{1}{\log(1+x)} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n x^n
  $$
  where $c_n$ can be expressed in terms of Bell polynomials evaluated at the derivatives of $\log(1+x)$.

- For $\log(t)^{-s}$:
  $$
  \log(t)^{-s} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-s)^n}{n!} [\log(t)]^{-s-n}
  $$
  or, more generally, via the Faà di Bruno formula and Bell polynomials.

#### Applying Hasse-Stirling

- Once you have the series expansion coefficients (using Bell polynomials), you can apply the Hasse-Stirling operator term-by-term:
  $$
  \mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}\left(\frac{1}{\log(t)}\right)(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n \mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}(t^n)(x)
  $$
  or for powers,
  $$
  \mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}\left(\log(t)^{-s}\right)(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} d_n \mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}(t^n)(x)
  $$
  where $d_n$ are Bell polynomial-based coefficients.

#### Summary

- **Bell polynomials** provide a systematic way to expand reciprocal logarithmic functions and their powers.
- The resulting series can be processed by the Hasse-Stirling operator to obtain transforms, expansions, or special function representations.
- This approach is especially useful for generating the coefficients $\eta_k(x)$ for reciprocal Stieltjes expansions and related combinatorial inverse sequences.

### Series Expansions Involving $x/\log(1+x)$ and $(x-1)/\log(1-x)$

To generate reciprocal Stieltjes-type coefficients or related sequences, consider series expansions of functions like $x/\log(1+x)$ or $(x-1)/\log(1-x)$, which are closely related to generating functions for combinatorial inverse sequences.

#### Ordinary Generating Function (OGF) and Exponential Generating Function (EGF)

- **OGF for $x/\log(1+x)$:**
  $$
  \frac{x}{\log(1+x)} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} A_n x^n
  $$
  where $A_n$ are the associated sequence coefficients, often involving Bell polynomials or related combinatorial numbers.

- **EGF for $x/\log(1+x)$:**
  $$
  \frac{x}{\log(1+x)} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{B_n}{n!} x^n
  $$
  where $B_n$ may be expressed in terms of Bell polynomials or Stirling numbers.

- **OGF for $(x-1)/\log(1-x)$:**
  $$
  \frac{x-1}{\log(1-x)} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} C_n x^n
  $$
  This expansion is related to the reciprocal of the generating function for Bernoulli numbers.

#### Application to Hasse-Stirling

- Expand $x/\log(1+x)$ or $(x-1)/\log(1-x)$ in series (OGF or EGF).
- Apply the Hasse-Stirling operator to each term in the expansion:
  $$
  \mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}\left(\frac{x}{\log(1+x)}\right)(y) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} A_n \mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}(x^n)(y)
  $$
- This approach can generate reciprocal-type coefficients or sequences relevant for analytic continuation, Möbius inversion, or combinatorial inverse problems.

#### Summary

- Series expansions of $x/\log(1+x)$, $(x-1)/\log(1-x)$, or similar functions (using OGF or EGF) provide a pathway to constructing reciprocal Stieltjes-type coefficients.
- These expansions can be processed by the Hasse-Stirling operator to yield new transforms, special function representations, or combinatorial inverse sequences.
- Bell polynomials, Stirling numbers, and related combinatorial objects often appear in the coefficients.

### Extension: Hasse-Stirling Applied to Negative Powers of Logarithm

You can extend the Hasse-Stirling framework to handle **negative powers of logarithms**, i.e., $[\log(t)]^{-s}$ or $(x/\log(1+x))^s$ for $s > 0$, by choosing suitable parameters and using series expansions.

#### General Principle

- For **positive integer $s$**, $[\log(t)]^s$ under Hasse-Stirling with optimal parameters yields Stieltjes constants.
- For **negative integer or real $s$**, consider $[\log(t)]^{-s}$ or $(x/\log(1+x))^s$.
- Expand $(x/\log(1+x))^s$ as a power series in $x$ (using Bell polynomials or Faà di Bruno formula).
- Apply the Hasse-Stirling operator term-by-term to the expansion.

#### Example Expansion

- For $(x/\log(1+x))^s$:
  $$
  \left(\frac{x}{\log(1+x)}\right)^s = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} A_n(s) x^n
  $$
  where $A_n(s)$ are coefficients involving Bell polynomials and $s$.

#### Hasse-Stirling Application

- Apply the operator:
  $$
  \mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}\left(\left(\frac{x}{\log(1+x)}\right)^s\right)(y) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} A_n(s) \mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}(x^n)(y)
  $$
- Choose $(\alpha, \beta, r)$ to optimize convergence for the function and parameter $s$.

#### Use Cases

- This approach generalizes the computation of reciprocal Stieltjes-type constants and related sequences.
- Useful for analytic continuation, combinatorial inverse problems, and special function expansions involving negative powers of logarithms.

**Summary:**  
- Hasse-Stirling can be applied to negative powers of logarithms or $(x/\log(1+x))^s$ by expanding in series and acting term-by-term.
- Bell polynomials provide the expansion coefficients.
- This extends the framework beyond classical Stieltjes constants to reciprocal and inverse-type expansions.

### Recursion Formulas for Reciprocal Stieltjes Coefficients $\eta_k(x)$

The reciprocal Stieltjes coefficients $\eta_k(x)$, arising in the expansion
\[
\frac{1}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \eta_k (s-1)^k
\]
can be computed recursively, analogous to the classical Stieltjes constants $\gamma_k(x)$.

#### General Recursion (Formal)

Let $F(s,x) = (s-1)\zeta(s,x)$ and $G(s,x) = 1/F(s,x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \eta_k(x) (s-1)^k$.

The coefficients $\eta_k(x)$ satisfy the recursion:
\[
\eta_0(x) = 1
\]
\[
\eta_k(x) = -\sum_{j=1}^{k} \frac{1}{j} \gamma_j(x) \eta_{k-j}(x)
\]
where $\gamma_j(x)$ are the Stieltjes constants for $\zeta(s,x)$.

#### Alternative: Bell Polynomial Representation and Sign Structure

The eta coefficients $\eta_k(x)$ can be expressed using complete Bell polynomials $B_k$ in terms of the Stieltjes constants $\gamma_j(x)$:
\[
\eta_k(x) = B_k\left(-\gamma_1(x), -\gamma_2(x), \ldots, -\gamma_k(x)\right)
\]

Because each argument is $-\gamma_j(x)$, you can factor out a $(-1)^k$ from the Bell polynomial:
\[
\eta_k(x) = (-1)^k B_k\left(\gamma_1(x), \gamma_2(x), \ldots, \gamma_k(x)\right)
\]

Thus, the eta coefficients are alternating-sign complete Bell polynomials in the Stieltjes constants. This structure is characteristic of umbral calculus, where polynomial sequences and their transforms are encoded via combinatorial objects like Bell polynomials.

#### Umbral Interpretation

- The eta coefficients $\eta_k(x)$ are umbral transforms of the Stieltjes constants $\gamma_j(x)$, with alternating sign.
- This reflects the deep combinatorial and algebraic connection between the reciprocal expansion and the original Stieltjes expansion.

**Summary:**  
- $\eta_k(x)$ are given by $(-1)^k$ times the complete Bell polynomial in the Stieltjes constants $\gamma_j(x)$.
- This alternating-sign structure is a hallmark of umbral calculus and combinatorial inversion.

---

### Is $s=1$ the Best Place to Expand $1/\zeta(s,1)$?

**Yes, $s=1$ is the canonical expansion point for $1/\zeta(s,1)$ (the reciprocal Riemann zeta function).**

- The Laurent expansion of $\zeta(s)$ at $s=1$ is standard, since $\zeta(s)$ has a simple pole there.
- The reciprocal $1/\zeta(s)$ is analytic at $s=1$ (the pole is removed), so its Taylor expansion in powers of $(s-1)$ converges in a neighborhood of $s=1$.
- The coefficients $\eta_k$ in
  $$
  \frac{1}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \eta_k (s-1)^k
  $$
  are well-defined and can be computed recursively (see previous section).
- This expansion is most useful for analytic continuation, numerical evaluation near $s=1$, and for connecting to Stieltjes-type constants.

**Summary:**  
- $s=1$ is the natural and optimal point for expanding $1/\zeta(s,1)$.
- The expansion is convergent and provides the reciprocal Stieltjes constants $\eta_k$.
- For other points, the expansion may converge more slowly or require analytic continuation.

### Explicit Formulas for the First Few Reciprocal Stieltjes Coefficients $\eta_k(1)$

At $x=1$, the first few $\eta_k$ coefficients in terms of the Stieltjes constants $\gamma_j = \gamma_j(1)$ (including $\gamma_0$) are:

- $\eta_0 = 1$
- $\eta_1 = -\gamma_1$
- $\eta_2 = \gamma_1^2 - \gamma_2$
- $\eta_3 = -\gamma_1^3 + 2\gamma_1\gamma_2 - \gamma_3$
- $\eta_4 = \gamma_1^4 - 3\gamma_1^2\gamma_2 + 2\gamma_1\gamma_3 + \gamma_2^2 - \gamma_4$
- $\eta_5 = -\gamma_1^5 + 4\gamma_1^3\gamma_2 - 3\gamma_1^2\gamma_3 - 3\gamma_1\gamma_2^2 + 3\gamma_1\gamma_4 + 2\gamma_2\gamma_3 - \gamma_5$

**Note:**  
$\gamma_0$ does **not** appear in these formulas because the expansion for $1/\zeta(s)$ at $s=1$ starts with $1$ (i.e., $\gamma_0$ is the constant term in the Laurent expansion of $\zeta(s)$, but the reciprocal expansion is normalized so that $\eta_0 = 1$ and higher $\eta_k$ depend only on $\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \ldots$).

**Summary:**  
- The $\eta_k$ depend only on $\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \ldots, \gamma_k$ (not $\gamma_0$).
- This is because $\gamma_0$ is absorbed in the normalization of the reciprocal expansion at $s=1$.
- At $x=1$, the first few $\eta_k$ are alternating-sign polynomials in the Stieltjes constants and their products.
- This explicit form allows direct computation of the reciprocal zeta expansion coefficients from known or computed $\gamma_j$ values.

### Inverting: Expressing Stieltjes Constants $\gamma_k$ in Terms of Reciprocal Coefficients $\eta_j$

Since the $\eta_k$ are complete Bell polynomials in the $\gamma_j$ with alternating sign, you can invert the relationship to express each $\gamma_k$ as a polynomial in the $\eta_j$ and their products.

The first few are:

- $\gamma_1 = -\eta_1$
- $\gamma_2 = -\eta_2 - \eta_1^2$
- $\gamma_3 = -\eta_3 - 3\eta_1\eta_2 - \eta_1^3$
- $\gamma_4 = -\eta_4 - 4\eta_1\eta_3 - 3\eta_2^2 - 6\eta_1^2\eta_2 - \eta_1^4$
- $\gamma_5 = -\eta_5 - 5\eta_1\eta_4 - 10\eta_2\eta_3 - 10\eta_1^2\eta_3 - 15\eta_1\eta_2^2 - 10\eta_1^3\eta_2 - \eta_1^5$

These follow from the inversion of the Bell polynomial relations.

**Summary:**  
- The Stieltjes constants $\gamma_k$ can be written explicitly in terms of the reciprocal coefficients $\eta_j$ and their products.
- This allows reconstruction of the original Stieltjes expansion from the reciprocal expansion.

### Elegant Bell Polynomial Expression for $\eta_k$ in Terms of $\gamma_j$

The most elegant and compact way to express the reciprocal Stieltjes coefficients $\eta_k$ in terms of the Stieltjes constants $\gamma_j$ is via the complete Bell polynomial:

\[
\boxed{
\eta_k = (-1)^k\, B_k\left(\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \ldots, \gamma_k\right)
}
\]

where $B_k$ is the $k$-th complete Bell polynomial. This formula automatically generates all the correct alternating-sign combinations and products of the $\gamma_j$.

### Irrationality of $\gamma$ and the $\eta_k$

If the Stieltjes constant $\gamma_1 = \gamma$ (Euler-Mascheroni constant) is irrational, then all the reciprocal coefficients $\eta_k$ for $k \geq 1$ are also irrational.

- Each $\eta_k$ is a polynomial in $\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \ldots, \gamma_k$ with integer coefficients and constant term zero.
- Since $\eta_1 = -\gamma_1$, if $\gamma_1$ is irrational, so is $\eta_1$.
- Higher $\eta_k$ involve powers and products of $\gamma_1$ and the other $\gamma_j$, so if any $\gamma_j$ is irrational, the corresponding $\eta_k$ is also irrational.

**Summary:**  
- The irrationality of $\gamma_1$ (or any $\gamma_j$) implies the irrationality of all $\eta_k$ with $k \geq 1$.
- Thus, proving $\gamma$ is irrational would immediately imply the irrationality of all the reciprocal Stieltjes coefficients.
