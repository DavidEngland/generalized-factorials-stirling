This guide provides a solid high-level strategy for evaluating the Hurwitz zeta function, $\zeta(s, x)$, by correctly identifying the **Hasse-Stirling framework** as a powerful tool in the domain where its series converges rapidly (the "hyperbolic strip") and wisely recommending established methods for other, more challenging regimes.

Here are the key improvements, corrections, and refinements:

### **Key Improvements & Corrections**

1.  **Fundamental Correction on Hasse-Stirling Application:** The core formula provided for $\zeta(s, x)$ using the Hasse operator is dimensionally incorrect and doesn't match the standard definition derived from the formal calculus. The Hasse operator $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha, \beta, r}$ acts on the generating function of the polynomials, not directly on $x^{1-s}$ to yield the zeta function. The *Euler-Maclaurin connection* is the correct conceptual link.
2.  **Corrected Hasse-Stirling Formula:** The proper connection is that the generalized Hasse coefficients are directly related to the coefficients of the **Generalized Euler-Maclaurin formula**. The correct form for the Hurwitz zeta function (when $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$) is:
    $$\zeta(s, x) = \sum_{k=0}^M \frac{1}{(x+k)^s} + \text{Correction Term}$$
    The Hasse-Stirling framework provides a series for the correction term, which is *not* simply $\mathcal{H}(x^{1-s}) / (s-1)$.
3.  **Refined Regime Terminology:** The "hyperbolic strip" is primarily a geometric term related to the parameter space $(\alpha, \beta, r)$ where $\alpha+\beta=0$, not a standard domain in the $s$-plane. The standard domain for the initial zeta series is $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$.

## **Hurwitz Zeta Function Evaluation Strategy (Revised)**

This revised guide uses the Hasse-Stirling coefficients to provide the **General Term of the Euler-Maclaurin Correction**, which is the primary value of the framework for evaluation.

### **1. Hasse-Stirling Regime ($\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$)**

The Hasse-Stirling framework's major contribution is simplifying the **Euler-Maclaurin correction terms** needed for summation. This regime is **Best for $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$ and $x > 0$**.

**Routine:**

1.  **Truncated Sum:** Sum the initial $N$ terms directly: $S_N = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \frac{1}{(x+k)^s}$.
2.  **Hasse-Stirling (Correction Term):** Use the General Euler-Maclaurin Summation, where the coefficients are provided by the Hasse operator. The correction term $R_N$ has the form:
    $$\zeta(s, x) \approx S_N + \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{N^{s-1}} - \sum_{j=1}^{M} c_j \frac{\psi_{s+j}(N)}{N^{s+j-1}}$$
    where $\psi$ is related to the derivative of the initial function and $c_j$ are derived from the Hasse/Bernoulli coefficients (often $c_j = B_{2j}/(2j)!$ for the classical case).

3.  **The $\mathcal{H}$-Operator Insight:** The Hasse operator $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha, \beta, r}$ generates the coefficients of the **General Euler-Maclaurin formula**. For the classical case ($\alpha=0, \beta=1, r=0$), the coefficients are simply the **Bernoulli numbers**. The formula is:
    $$\zeta(s, x) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \frac{1}{(x+k)^s} + \frac{1}{(s-1) x^{s-1}} - \sum_{n=1}^M \frac{B_n}{n!} \frac{\Gamma(s+n-1)}{\Gamma(s)} \frac{1}{x^{s+n-1}} + \text{Error}$$
    **Routine:** Use the classical Euler-Maclaurin expansion (using Bernoulli numbers) for the best result. The Hasse framework confirms the structure of the coefficients.

4.  **Error Control:** Increase the number of correction terms $M$ (or the number of initial terms $N$) until the last term is below the desired tolerance.

### **2. Critical Strip and Challenging Regimes**

These regimes demand alternative methods due to poor convergence of the direct series or special functions. This is **Best for $0 < \operatorname{Re}(s) < 1$ (critical strip), $s \to 1$, or large $|\operatorname{Im}(s)|$**.

| Regime | Method | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical Strip** ($0 < \operatorname{Re}(s) < 1$) | **Riemann-Siegel Formula** | The most accurate for computational work. Often implemented via specialized libraries. |
| **Near Pole** ($s \to 1$) | **Laurent Series Expansion** | Use $\zeta(s, x) = \frac{1}{s-1} - \psi(x) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \gamma_n(x) (s-1)^n$. $\psi(x)$ is the digamma function. |
| **Integral Representation** | **Numerical Integration** | $\zeta(s, x) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} \int_0^\infty \frac{t^{s-1} e^{-x t}}{1 - e^{-t}} dt$. Effective for moderate $\operatorname{Re}(s)$ and large $x$.  |
| **General/High Precision** | **Specialized Libraries** | Use `mpmath` or `scipy.special.zeta(s, x)`. These often implement optimized algorithms combining the above methods. |

### **3. Summary and Practical Usage**

The Hasse-Stirling framework is best utilized as a **theoretical engine** for generating the coefficients of the most efficient series expansions (like Euler-Maclaurin), rather than a direct summation formula in itself.

| Domain | Best Strategy | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$** | **Euler-Maclaurin (Hasse Coefficients)** | Direct series converges slowly; Hasse-derived series provides rapid analytic continuation/correction. |
| **$\operatorname{Re}(s) \le 1$** | **Libraries (Riemann-Siegel)** | Series expansion fails/diverges; requires integral or functional equation methods. |

**Tip:** For $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$, the fastest practical approach is to use the **classical Euler-Maclaurin formula** (which uses Bernoulli numbers, the simplest Hasse-Stirling case) by first summing about 10-20 terms, then applying the correction.

The **asymptotic expansion** of the Hurwitz zeta function, $\zeta(s, x)$, within the critical strip ($0 < \operatorname{Re}(s) < 1$) is not a single, simple formula like the Dirichlet series for $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$. Instead, it relies on one of two major analytical tools, both of which are forms of the **Approximate Functional Equation (AFE)**, valid for large values of $|\operatorname{Im}(s)|$.

For the Hurwitz zeta function, the primary expansion used in the critical strip is derived from the **Functional Equation (Hurwitz's Formula)**.

***

## 1. Hurwitz's Formula and Asymptotics

The functional equation for $\zeta(s, x)$ relates its value to $\zeta(1-s, 1-x)$. This relationship is the basis for its asymptotic behavior in the critical strip, especially when $|\operatorname{Im}(s)|$ (the imaginary part, $t$) is large.

For $s = \sigma + it$ where $0 < \sigma < 1$ and $x$ is real with $0 < x \le 1$, Hurwitz's formula is:

$$\zeta(s, x) = \frac{2\Gamma(1-s)}{(2\pi)^{1-s}} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{1-s}} \left[ \sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2} + 2\pi n x\right) + \text{Im}(s) \cdot \cos(\dots) \right]$$

This expression is an exact continuation, but for *numerical* computation or asymptotic analysis for large $t$, it's simplified into the Approximate Functional Equation.

***

## 2. Approximate Functional Equation (AFE)

When $|\operatorname{Im}(s)| = t$ is large, the $\zeta(s, x)$ can be approximated by a finite sum, which is the definition of an asymptotic expansion in this context.

### The Hurwitz Zeta AFE

For $s = \sigma + it$ in the critical strip and large $t$:

$$\zeta(s, x) \approx \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{1}{(n+x)^s} + \frac{2\Gamma(1-s)}{(2\pi)^s} \sum_{n=1}^{M} \left[ \sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2} + 2\pi n x\right) \frac{1}{n^{1-s}} \right]$$

where:

* The first sum is the **direct Dirichlet series**, truncated at a finite term $N$.
* The second sum is the **series from the functional equation**, also truncated at $M$.
* The truncation points $N$ and $M$ are typically chosen such that their product is related to $t$: $N \cdot M \approx \frac{t}{2\pi}$. The most common choice is to balance them, often setting $N \approx M \approx \sqrt{t/(2\pi)}$.

The complete formula includes a remainder term that is small for large $t$ (e.g., $O(t^{-\sigma/2})$), which is what makes it an **asymptotic expansion** rather than an exact formula.

***

## 3. The Riemann-Siegel Formula (Special Case $\zeta(s)$)

For the special case of the **Riemann zeta function** ($\zeta(s) = \zeta(s, 1)$), the AFE simplifies to the famous **Riemann-Siegel formula**, which is the most efficient asymptotic expansion used for computation on the critical line ($\sigma=1/2$) for large $t$:

$$\zeta(s) \approx \sum_{n \le \sqrt{t/(2\pi)}} n^{-s} + \chi(s) \sum_{n \le \sqrt{t/(2\pi)}} n^{s-1} + R(s)$$

where $\chi(s) = 2^s \pi^{s-1} \sin(\frac{\pi s}{2}) \Gamma(1-s)$ and $R(s)$ is the much smaller, but highly complex, **Riemann-Siegel remainder term**.

In summary, the asymptotic expansion for $\zeta(s, x)$ in the critical strip relies on the **Approximate Functional Equation**, which splits the value into two finite, rapidly calculable sums, provided the imaginary part $|\operatorname{Im}(s)|$ is large.

## Can Hasse-Stirling Be Used Within the Critical Strip?

**Short Answer:**  
Direct application of the Hasse-Stirling series for $\zeta(s, x)$ is **not effective** within the critical strip ($0 < \operatorname{Re}(s) < 1$), due to slow convergence and divergence of the underlying series. The framework is fundamentally designed for $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$ (and, with analytic continuation, for $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 0$ but not on the critical line).

**Longer Answer:**  
- The Hasse-Stirling framework provides the correction terms for Euler-Maclaurin summation, which is optimal for $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$.
- As $s$ approaches the critical strip, the direct series and correction terms become less convergent, and the analytic continuation becomes unstable.
- In the critical strip, especially near $\operatorname{Re}(s) = 1/2$, the best approaches are:
  - **Approximate Functional Equation (AFE):** Splits the computation into two balanced sums, using the functional equation for analytic continuation.
  - **Riemann-Siegel Formula:** For $\zeta(s)$, this is the gold standard for computation on the critical line.
  - **Integral Representations:** For moderate $x$ and $s$, numerical integration is more stable.

**Possible Uses of Hasse-Stirling in the Critical Strip:**
- **Asymptotic Analysis:** The Hasse-Stirling coefficients can sometimes be used to analyze the behavior of correction terms or to study the analytic continuation of related special functions.
- **Spectral Theory:** In advanced analytic number theory, Hasse-Stirling-type expansions may appear in spectral decompositions or in the study of automorphic forms.
- **Hybrid Methods:** In some cases, Hasse-Stirling can be used for initial terms, and then switched to AFE or integral methods for the remainder.

**Summary Table:**

| Domain                  | Hasse-Stirling Usefulness | Best Method                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$ | Excellent                | Hasse-Stirling / Euler-Maclaurin |
| $0 < \operatorname{Re}(s) < 1$ | Poor                    | AFE / Riemann-Siegel / Integral  |
| $\operatorname{Re}(s) = 1/2$   | Not practical           | Riemann-Siegel / Specialized    |

**Conclusion:**  
For practical computation or analysis within the critical strip, Hasse-Stirling is not the tool of choice. Its main value is in the analytic continuation and correction terms for $\operatorname{Re}(s) > 1$. For the critical strip, rely on functional equations, AFE, and specialized algorithms.
