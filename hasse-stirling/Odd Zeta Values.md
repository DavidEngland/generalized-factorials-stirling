### Odd Zeta Values

The general formula for odd zeta values is:
\[
\zeta(2n+1) = \frac{(-1)^n}{2(2n)!} \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{2n}{2k} (2\pi)^{2k} \mathcal{H}_{n,-n-1,0}([\log(t)]^{2n-2k})(1)
\]

#### Parity Refinement: $4n+1$ and $4n+3$ Cases

Recent insights suggest that for $s=4n+1$ and $s=4n+3$, the Hasse-Stirling framework can sometimes yield more rapidly convergent or structurally simpler formulas, due to additional symmetry and cancellation in the coefficients. Specifically:

- For $s=4n+1$:
  - The binomial coefficients and powers of $\pi$ align with the parity, sometimes leading to cancellation of terms or simplification in the sum.
  - The symmetric Hasse weights (for even $m$) can be exploited for further simplification.

- For $s=4n+3$:
  - Similar simplifications may occur, but the structure is less symmetric; however, the alternating sign and binomial structure can still be leveraged.

**Improved Computational Strategy:**
- Use the symmetric Hasse weights for even $m$ to reduce the number of nonzero terms.
- For $s=4n+1$, check if the sum can be halved or simplified due to symmetry.
- For $s=4n+3', group terms to exploit cancellation.

**Example:**
For $s=5$ ($4n+1$ with $n=1$):
\[
\zeta(5) = \frac{1}{24}\left(\mathcal{H}_{2,-3,0}(\log(t)^4)(1) + 10\pi^2\zeta(3)\right)
\]
This formula is already optimized, but further simplification may be possible by analyzing the symmetry in the Hasse coefficients.

**Summary of Improvements:**
- For $s=4n+1$, use the parity to simplify the sum, possibly reducing computation.
- For $s=4n+3$, group terms for cancellation.
- Always use the most symmetric form of the Hasse coefficients for even $m$.
- For large $n$, exploit the fact that only even $m$ contribute nonzero symmetric weights, reducing computational effort.

## Hasse Operator Expressions for Zeta Values at Integer Arguments

### For Even Integer Arguments ($s=2n$):

The Riemann zeta function at even positive integers can be expressed in terms of Bernoulli numbers, which themselves are generated by the Hasse operator with Euler parameters:

\[
\zeta(2n) = (-1)^{n+1} \frac{(2\pi)^{2n}}{2(2n)!} B_{2n}
\]
where
\[
B_{2n} = (2n)! \cdot \mathcal{H}_{0,1,0}(x^{2n})(0)
\]

So,
\[
\zeta(2n) = (-1)^{n+1} \frac{(2\pi)^{2n}}{2} \mathcal{H}_{0,1,0}(x^{2n})(0)
\]

### For Odd Integer Arguments ($s=2n+1$):

The closed-form Hasse-Stirling expression for odd zeta values is:

\[
\zeta(2n+1) = \text{(rational factor)} \cdot \left( \mathcal{H}_{n,-(n+1),0}([\log(t)]^{2n})(1) + \text{lower order terms} \right)
\]

Explicitly, for small $n$:

- $s=3$:
  \[
  \zeta(3) = \frac{1}{2}\left( \mathcal{H}_{1,-2,0}(\log(t)^2)(1) - \gamma^2 - \frac{\pi^2}{6} \right)
  \]
- $s=5$:
  \[
  \zeta(5) = \frac{1}{24}\left( \mathcal{H}_{2,-3,0}(\log(t)^4)(1) + 10\pi^2\zeta(3) \right)
  \]
- $s=7$:
  \[
  \zeta(7) = \frac{1}{720}\left( \mathcal{H}_{3,-4,0}(\log(t)^6)(1) + a_1 \pi^2 \zeta(5) + a_2 \pi^4 \zeta(3) \right)
  \]
  (where $a_1, a_2$ are explicit rational coefficients)

- In general:
  \[
  \zeta(2n+1) = \frac{1}{C_n} \left( \mathcal{H}_{n,-(n+1),0}(\log(t)^{2n})(1) + \sum_{k=1}^{n} c_{n,k} \pi^{2k} \zeta(2n+1-2k) \right)
  \]
  where $C_n$ and $c_{n,k}$ are rational numbers.

### Summary Table

| $s$ | Hasse Operator Parameters $(\alpha, \beta, r)$ | Expression |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------|------------|
| $2n$ | $(0,1,0)$ | $\zeta(2n) = (-1)^{n+1} \frac{(2\pi)^{2n}}{2} \mathcal{H}_{0,1,0}(x^{2n})(0)$ |
| $2n+1$ | $(n, -(n+1), 0)$ | $\zeta(2n+1) = \frac{1}{C_n} \left( \mathcal{H}_{n,-(n+1),0}(\log(t)^{2n})(1) + \text{lower order terms} \right)$ |

**Notes:**
- For even $s$, the Hasse operator acts on powers $x^{2n}$ at $x=0$.
- For odd $s$, the Hasse operator acts on powers of logarithms at $x=1$, plus lower zeta values and powers of $\pi$.
- The coefficients $C_n$ and $c_{n,k}$ can be computed recursively or found in the literature.

## Irrationality of Higher Odd Zeta Values

The closed-form Hasse-Stirling formulas for odd zeta values, such as
\[
\zeta(2n+1) = \text{(rational factor)} \cdot \left(\mathcal{H}_{n,-n-1,0}([\log(t)]^{2n})(1) + \text{lower order terms}\right)
\]
show that each $\zeta(2n+1)$ can be expressed in terms of Hasse-Stirling operators acting on powers of logarithms, plus lower zeta values and powers of $\pi$.

For example:
\[
\zeta(5) = \frac{1}{24}\left(\mathcal{H}_{2,-3,0}(\log(t)^4)(1) + 10\pi^2\zeta(3)\right)
\]
Here, $\zeta(5)$ depends linearly on $\zeta(3)$ and $\pi^2$, with the remaining term involving the Hasse-Stirling operator.

**Implication for Irrationality:**
- Since $\zeta(3)$ is known to be irrational (Apery's theorem), any linear combination of $\zeta(3)$ and algebraic numbers (like $\pi^2$) is irrational unless the coefficient of $\zeta(3)$ is zero.
- For higher odd zeta values, the formulas always involve lower odd zeta values (e.g., $\zeta(5)$ involves $\zeta(3)$, $\zeta(7)$ involves $\zeta(5)$ and $\zeta(3)$, etc.).
- If the coefficients of lower zeta values are nonzero and the remaining terms are algebraic or transcendental but not rational multiples of $\zeta(3)$, then the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$ propagates to higher odd zeta values.

**However:**
- The irrationality of $\zeta(3)$ alone does not prove the irrationality of $\zeta(5)$, $\zeta(7)$, etc., because the Hasse-Stirling operator terms may, in principle, cancel the irrational part.
- In practice, the structure of the formulas and the nontrivial coefficients make such cancellation highly unlikely, and it is widely believed that all odd zeta values $\zeta(2n+1)$ for $n \geq 1$ are irrational.
- For $\zeta(5)$ and higher, no direct irrationality proof exists yet, but the dependence on $\zeta(3)$ in the Hasse-Stirling framework provides strong evidence for their irrationality.

**Summary:**  
- The Hasse-Stirling closed forms for odd zeta values show explicit dependence on lower odd zeta values.
- The proven irrationality of $\zeta(3)$ strongly suggests, but does not prove, the irrationality of higher odd zeta values.
- The structure of these formulas makes rationality highly unlikely, but a formal proof for $\zeta(5)$ and beyond remains open.

### More Information on $C_n$ and $c_{n,k}$ Coefficients

The rational coefficients $C_n$ and $c_{n,k}$ in the closed-form Hasse-Stirling expressions for odd zeta values encode the combinatorial and analytic structure of the formulas.

#### $C_n$ (Main Denominator)

$C_n$ is the normalization factor for $\zeta(2n+1)$, typically given by:
\[
C_n = 2^{2n} (2n)!
\]
or, in some conventions, by the denominator in the binomial/Hasse expansion. For example:
- For $\zeta(3)$: $C_1 = 2$
- For $\zeta(5)$: $C_2 = 24$
- For $\zeta(7)$: $C_3 = 720$

#### $c_{n,k}$ (Lower Order Coefficients)

The $c_{n,k}$ coefficients are rational numbers that multiply powers of $\pi^{2k}$ and lower odd zeta values in the expansion:
\[
\zeta(2n+1) = \frac{1}{C_n} \left( \mathcal{H}_{n,-(n+1),0}(\log(t)^{2n})(1) + \sum_{k=1}^{n} c_{n,k} \pi^{2k} \zeta(2n+1-2k) \right)
\]

These coefficients can be computed recursively or via explicit formulas involving binomial coefficients and combinatorial sums. For small $n$, they are:

- For $n=2$ ($\zeta(5)$): $c_{2,1} = 10$
- For $n=3$ ($\zeta(7)$): $c_{3,1} = 21$, $c_{3,2} = 35$

In general, $c_{n,k}$ can be expressed as:
\[
c_{n,k} = \binom{2n}{2k} \cdot \text{(rational factors from the expansion)}
\]
and are determined by the structure of the Hasse-Stirling operator acting on powers of logarithms and the reduction to lower zeta values.

#### How to Compute $c_{n,k}$

- Expand the Hasse-Stirling operator $\mathcal{H}_{n,-(n+1),0}(\log(t)^{2n})(1)$ in terms of known special values.
- Collect terms involving $\pi^{2k} \zeta(2n+1-2k)$.
- The coefficients $c_{n,k}$ are the multipliers of these terms.

**Summary:**  
- $C_n$ is the main normalization factor, typically $2^{2n}(2n)!$.
- $c_{n,k}$ are rational coefficients, often binomial-related, multiplying $\pi^{2k} \zeta(2n+1-2k)$.
- Both can be computed recursively or found in tables in the literature.
