## 1. The Transform
\[
\mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}(f)(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \sum_{n=0}^{m} H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}\, f(x+n).
\]

- This is a **double series transform**: for each \(m\), you sum over \(n=0,\dots,m\).
- The coefficients \(H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}\) encode the combinatorial/analytic structure.
- The operator is reminiscent of **Hasse–Schmidt derivations** or generalized finite difference transforms.

---

## 2. Coefficients via Stirling-type numbers
\[
H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} = \frac{1}{m+1} \sum_{j=0}^{n} (-1)^{\,n-j} \binom{n}{j} S(m,j;\alpha,\beta,r).
\]

- Here \(S(m,j;\alpha,\beta,r)\) are some generalized Stirling numbers (depending on \(\alpha,\beta,r\)).
- The alternating binomial sum is a **finite difference operator** acting on \(S(m,j;\cdot)\).
- The prefactor \(1/(m+1)\) normalizes the coefficients.

---

## 3. Recurrence relation
\[
H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} = H_{m-1,n-1}^{\alpha,\beta,r} - \frac{m\alpha + n\beta + r}{m+2}\, H_{m-1,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r},
\]
with \(H_{0,0}^{\alpha,\beta,r}=1\).

- This is a **two-dimensional recurrence** in \((m,n)\).
- The first term shifts both indices down by 1.
- The second term keeps \(n\) fixed but reduces \(m\).
- The coefficients \(\frac{m\alpha+n\beta+r}{m+2}\) encode the parameter dependence.

---

## 4. Structural observations
- **Triangular support:** Since \(n\le m\), the coefficients form a triangular array.
- **Boundary conditions:**
  - For \(n=0\), the recurrence reduces to
    \[
    H_{m,0} = -\frac{m\alpha+r}{m+2}\, H_{m-1,0}.
    \]
  - For \(n=m\), the recurrence simplifies to
    \[
    H_{m,m} = H_{m-1,m-1}.
    \]
    So along the diagonal, all coefficients equal 1.
- **Symmetry:** The recurrence mixes \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) in different roles: \(\alpha\) couples to \(m\), \(\beta\) to \(n\).

---

## 5. Computational aspects
- **Complexity:**
  - To compute all \(H_{m,n}\) up to \(m=M\), you need \(O(M^2)\) operations.
  - Each step is constant-time (just arithmetic).
- **Stability:**
  - The recurrence involves subtraction, so for large \(m,n\) cancellation may occur.
  - For numerical work, high precision may be needed if \(\alpha,\beta,r\) are large or complex.
- **Error control:**
  - If the transform is truncated at \(m\le M\), the truncation error depends on the decay of \(f(x+n)\) and the growth of \(H_{m,n}\).
  - For analytic \(f\), one can often bound the tail using estimates on generalized Stirling numbers.

---

## 6. Connections
- This structure generalizes the **Hasse expansion** for logarithms and polylogarithms.
- The recurrence is reminiscent of those satisfied by **generalized Bernoulli numbers** or **Stirling numbers of the second kind**.
- The operator \(\mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}\) looks like a generating transform for special functions (e.g. zeta, polylogarithm, hypergeometric).

---

✅ So you now have:
- A **definition** via Stirling-type sums.
- A **recurrence** for efficient computation.
- **Boundary conditions** and structural properties.
- **Complexity estimates** for algorithmic use.

---

Would you like me to **derive explicit closed forms for small \(m,n\)** (say up to \(m=3\)) so you can see the pattern of \(H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}\) concretely, or would you prefer I focus on the **asymptotic growth of \(H_{m,n}\)** for large indices (which is crucial for truncation error in algorithms)?
