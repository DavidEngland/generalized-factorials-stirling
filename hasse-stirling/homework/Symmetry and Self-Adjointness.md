**Symmetry and Self-Adjointness:**

- The general Hasse operator is not **self-adjoint**, but it can be made symmetric or self-adjoint by choosing specific parameter valuesâ€”especially in the "hyperbolic strip" where $\alpha+\beta=0$.
- This property connects the Hasse-Stirling framework to the theory of **Hermite polynomials** and their self-adjoint operator structure.
- The inverse of the Hasse transform also exists, allowing for the retrieval of the original function from its Hasse representation.

**Symmetry and Self-Adjointness Homework Problem**

**Goal:** Learn how to form symmetric weights for the Hasse-Stirling operator and apply them to simple functions.

---

### Step 1: Recall the Hasse Coefficients

The Hasse coefficients are defined as:
$$
H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} = \frac{1}{m+1} \sum_{j=0}^{n} (-1)^{n-j} \binom{n}{j} S(m,j;\alpha,\beta,r)
$$
where $S(m,j;\alpha,\beta,r)$ are generalized Stirling numbers.

---

### Step 2: Form the Symmetric Weights

The symmetric weights are the average of the coefficient and its reverse:
$$
w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = \frac{H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} + H_{m,m-n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}}{2}
$$

**Hint:**
- For each $n$ from $0$ to $m$, compute $H_{m,n}$ and $H_{m,m-n}$, then take their average.
- This makes the operator symmetric with respect to $n \leftrightarrow m-n$.

---

### Step 3: Write the Symmetric Hasse Operator

The symmetric operator acts on a function $f(x)$ as:
$$
\mathcal{H}_m^{\text{sym}}(f)(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{m} w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} f(x+n)
$$

### Step 4: Try It Out on Simple Functions

Let $m=2$ and $\alpha=1$, $\beta=-1$, $r=0$ (on the hyperbolic strip):
- Compute $H_{2,0}$, $H_{2,1}$, $H_{2,2}$
- Compute $w_{2,0}^{\text{sym}}$, $w_{2,1}^{\text{sym}}$, $w_{2,2}^{\text{sym}}$
- Apply $\mathcal{H}_2^{\text{sym}}$ to $f(x) = x$, $f(x) = x^2$, $f(x) = e^x$

**Hint:**
- For $f(x) = x$, $\mathcal{H}_2^{\text{sym}}(f)(x) = w_{2,0}^{\text{sym}} x + w_{2,1}^{\text{sym}} (x+1) + w_{2,2}^{\text{sym}} (x+2)$

---

### Step 5: Explore Other Parameter Regimes

- Try $\alpha=0$, $\beta=1$, $r=0$ (Euler domain, outside hyperbolic strip)
- Try $\alpha=2$, $\beta=-2$, $r=0$ (on the hyperbolic strip)
- Try $\alpha=1$, $\beta=1$, $r=0$ (outside hyperbolic strip)

**Hint:**
- Compare the symmetry and numerical values of the weights in each case.
- Which choices make the operator self-adjoint? Which do not?

---

### Step 6: Reflect

- Why does symmetry in the weights matter for self-adjointness?
- How does the choice of parameters affect the symmetry?
- What do you notice about the results for $f(x) = x^2$ and $f(x) = e^x$?

---

**Challenge:**
- Prove that for even $m$ and $\alpha + \beta = 0$, the symmetric weights are always symmetric: $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = w_{m,m-n}^{\text{sym}}$.
- Can you find a function $f(x)$ and parameters where the symmetric operator is not self-adjoint?

**Bonus Problems: Applications and Simplifications of Symmetric Weights**

1. **Quantum Harmonic Oscillator:**
   - Show that for $m$ even and $\alpha + \beta = 0$, the symmetric weights $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$ can be interpreted as coefficients in the expansion of Hermite polynomials, which are eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator.
   - Apply $\mathcal{H}_m^{\text{sym}}$ to $f(x) = e^{-x^2/2}$ and interpret the result in terms of quantum ground state wavefunctions.

2. **Quantum Spin Chains:**
   - For $m=2$ and $\alpha = -\beta$, consider $f(x)$ as a spin configuration. Show how the symmetric operator can model exchange interactions with reflection symmetry.
   - Explore how the symmetry in weights relates to conservation laws in quantum spin systems.

3. **Simplification for Symmetric Potentials:**
   - Prove that if $f(x)$ is an even function and $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$ is symmetric, then $\mathcal{H}_m^{\text{sym}}(f)(x)$ simplifies to a sum over half the terms (i.e., $n=0$ to $m/2$), doubling the contribution for $n \neq m/2$.
   - Apply this to $f(x) = x^2$ and discuss the physical meaning in the context of quantum wells.

4. **Connection to Path Integrals:**
   - Show that the symmetric weights can be used to construct discrete approximations to path integrals with time-reversal symmetry.
   - For $\alpha = 0$, $\beta = 0$, $r=0$, interpret $\mathcal{H}_m^{\text{sym}}$ as a midpoint rule for quantum transition amplitudes.

5. **Symmetric Weights and Uncertainty Principle:**
   - Investigate how the symmetry of $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$ affects the spread (variance) of $\mathcal{H}_m^{\text{sym}}(f)(x)$ for $f(x)$ representing a quantum probability distribution.
   - Relate this to the minimum uncertainty states in quantum mechanics.

---

**Hints for Bonus Problems:**
- Look for simplifications when $f(x)$ is even or odd, and when $m$ is even.
- Try to connect the structure of the symmetric operator to known physical symmetries (parity, time-reversal, conservation laws).
- Consider how the averaging in the weights might correspond to physical averaging (e.g., over paths, states, or configurations).
