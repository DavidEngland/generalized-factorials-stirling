## Theoretical Foundation: Inverse Relationships in Exponential Generating Functions

For two exponential generating functions
\(f(x)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty \tfrac{a_m}{m!}x^m\) and
\(g(x)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty \tfrac{b_m}{m!}x^m\) with \(g(f(x))=x\),
there exists a unique parameter pair \((a,b)\) so that the coefficients \(\{b_n\}\) relate to \(\{a_k\}\) via
\[
b_n \;=\;\sum_{k=0}^n S_{n,k}(a,b)\,\;a_k.
\]

A sketch of the proof uses the compositional inverse condition, power–series substitution, and Faà di Bruno’s formula.  One shows that each coefficient identity aligns with the structure of a generalized Stirling transform, and the parameters \((a,b)\) are determined by matching series expansions.

## Bell-Polynomial Characterization (Operator Form)

Introduce any exponential generating function
\[
A(t)\;=\;\sum_{m\ge0}\frac{a_m}{m!}\,t^m
\]
and the Sheffer pair \((g_{a,b}(t),\,f_{a,b}(t))\) whose basic sequence is the \((a,b)\)-generalized factorial basis.  Define the operator
\[
U_{a,b}[A](t)\;:=\;g_{a,b}(t)\,\;A\bigl(f_{a,b}(t)\bigr)\;=\;\sum_{m\ge0}\frac{x_m^{(a,b)}}{m!}\,t^m,
\]
where \(x_m^{(a,b)}\) are the \((a,b)\)-reweighted coefficients.

For each fixed \((a,b)\), the array \(S_{n,k}(a,b)\) is the unique lower-triangular connection matrix satisfying
\[
B_n\bigl(1!\,x_1^{(a,b)},\,2!\,x_2^{(a,b)},\dots,n!\,x_n^{(a,b)}\bigr)
\;=\;n!\,\sum_{k=0}^n S_{n,k}(a,b)\,\frac{a_k}{k!},
\]
where \(B_n\) denotes the complete Bell polynomial.  This identity encapsulates how the generalized Stirling numbers translate between the monomial basis and the \((a,b)\)-factorial Sheffer basis.

## Computational Approach for Parameter Estimation

Determining \((a,b)\) from a known inverse pair \(\{a_m\}\) and \(\{b_n\}\) proceeds by forming “moment equations” via Bell polynomials.  A high-level procedure:

1. Apply the Bell-polynomial identity for successive \(n\) to generate nonlinear equations in \((a,b)\).
2. Gather the system of equations up to the desired order \(n_{\max}\).
3. Use symbolic or numerical solvers to find \((a,b)\) that satisfy all moment constraints.

Although closed-form scripts can become unwieldy, computer algebra systems like Maple or Mathematica streamline solving these moment systems.

## Further Insights and Directions

- Combinatorial Interpretations:  Each \(S_{n,k}(a,b)\) often counts structured partitions or tree-like objects weighted by \((a,b)\).
- Connections to Special Functions:  Generalized Stirling transforms intertwine with hypergeometric series and orthogonal polynomials.
- Software Implementations:  Libraries in Python (SymPy), Maple, and SageMath support Bell-polynomial manipulations and Sheffer sequences.
- Extensions:  One may extend to multivariate transforms or \(q\)-analogues by introducing additional parameters and corresponding Bell-type operators.

Exploring these avenues deepens both the theoretical framework and practical applications of generalized Stirling numbers.
