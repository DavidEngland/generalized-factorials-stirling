# Generalized Stirling Transform

## Classical Stirling Transform

The classical Stirling transform relates polynomial sequences through Stirling numbers:

- For Stirling numbers of the first kind $s(n,k)$:
  $x^{\underline{n}} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} s(n,k) x^k$ (expressing falling factorials in terms of powers)

- For Stirling numbers of the second kind $S(n,k)$:
  $x^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} S(n,k) x^{\underline{k}}$ (expressing powers in terms of falling factorials)

These transforms are inverses of each other, allowing conversion between different polynomial bases.

## Generalized Stirling Transform: A Basis Transformation Approach

### Refined Definition

The generalized Stirling transform is fundamentally about transformations between polynomial bases. Given two exponential generating functions (EGFs):

$$A(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n \frac{t^n}{n!} \quad \text{and} \quad B(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n \frac{t^n}{n!}$$

The generalized Stirling transform relates their coefficient sequences $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ through:

$$b_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} S_{n,k}(a,b) \cdot a_k$$

where $S_{n,k}(a,b)$ are the generalized Stirling numbers with parameters $(a,b)$. This transformation is especially meaningful when $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ are compositionally related in a specific way.

In the umbral calculus framework, this represents a Sheffer sequence transformation, where different polynomial bases are connected through structural parameters.

### Properties

1. **Duality**: The transform has a dual form relating the generalized Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds.

2. **Basis Transformation**: This provides a way to transform between different polynomial bases in function spaces.

3. **Parameter Dependence**: The specific values of $(a,b)$ determine how the bases are related and the characteristics of the transformation.

### Corrected Examples

- When transforming between the **power basis** and the **falling factorial basis**, we recover the classical Stirling transforms. This corresponds to specific parameter sets like $(a,b)=(0,1)$ or $(a,b)=(1,0)$.

- For compositionally inverse EGFs $f(x) = e^x-1$ and $g(x) = \ln(1+x)$, the coefficient sequences are related through generalized Stirling numbers with parameters approximately $(a,b)=(1,-1)$.

- For the rational function pair $f(x) = \frac{x}{1-x}$ and $g(x) = \frac{x}{1+x}$, the coefficient transformation involves parameters near $(a,b)=(0,-1)$.

## Applications

This generalized transform framework allows:

1. Conversion between various polynomial bases beyond the standard power and factorial bases
2. Development of efficient algorithms for polynomial manipulations
3. Analysis of combinatorial structures through different functional perspectives
4. Creation of specialized transforms for specific problem domains by selecting appropriate function pairs and parameters

## Mathematical Challenges

Open questions include:

1. Determining which function pairs $(f,g)$ yield closed-form expressions for the transform coefficients
2. Understanding how the parameters $(a,b)$ affect the convergence properties of the transform
3. Developing efficient computational methods for applying these transforms to large datasets

## Inverse Relationships in Exponential Generating Functions

### Theoretical Foundation

**Theorem 1:** *For any pair of compositionally inverse exponential generating functions, there exists a specific parameter pair $(a,b)$ for which the generalized Stirling numbers transform the coefficient sequence of one function to that of its inverse.*

Let $f(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} a_m \frac{x^m}{m!}$ and $g(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} b_m \frac{x^m}{m!}$ be two exponential generating functions where $g(f(x)) = x$. Then the coefficients $\{b_n\}$ can be derived from $\{a_m\}$ via the transformation:

$$b_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} S_{n,k}(a,b) \cdot a_k$$

where $S_{n,k}(a,b)$ are the generalized Stirling numbers with specific parameters $(a,b)$ determined by the functional relationship.

*Proof:* The condition $g(f(x)) = x$ implies:
$$b_0 + b_1 f(x) + \frac{b_2}{2!}[f(x)]^2 + \cdots = x$$

Substituting $f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \frac{a_2}{2!}x^2 + \cdots$ and applying Fa√† di Bruno's formula for the composition of power series, we obtain:

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n \sum_{k=0}^{n} B_{n,k}(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-k+1}) \frac{x^k}{k!}$$

where $B_{n,k}$ are the partial Bell polynomials. Comparing coefficients of $x^n$ and solving the resulting system of equations shows that the relationship between $\{a_m\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ follows the structure of generalized Stirling transformations with specific parameters $(a,b)$.

The parameter $b$ can be approximated from the first few terms:
$$b \approx -\frac{a_2 b_1^2 - a_1^2 b_2}{a_1^2 b_1}$$

For normalized functions with $a_0=b_0=0$ and $a_1=b_1=1$, this simplifies to $b \approx a_2-b_2$.

### Classic Example: Exponential and Logarithm

For the compositionally inverse pair:
- $f(x) = e^{rx} - 1 = rx + \frac{r^2x^2}{2!} + \cdots$
- $g(x) = \frac{1}{r}\ln(1+x) = \frac{x}{r} - \frac{x^2}{2r} + \frac{x^3}{3r} - \cdots$

We have $a_0 = 0$, $a_1 = r$, $a_2 = r^2$, and $b_0 = 0$, $b_1 = \frac{1}{r}$, $b_2 = -\frac{1}{2r}$

Applying the parameter estimation formula:
$$b \approx -\frac{r^2 \cdot (1/r)^2 - r^2 \cdot (-1/2r)}{r^2 \cdot (1/r)} = -1 + \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}$$

The exact value is $b = -1$, with the approximation improving as we consider higher-order terms.

This corresponds to Stirling numbers of the first kind with parameters $(a,b)=(1,-1)$.

### Extended Examples

#### Hyperbolic Functions

For hyperbolic sine and its inverse:
- $f(x) = \sinh(x) = x + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + \cdots$
- $g(x) = \text{arsinh}(x) = x - \frac{1}{2}\frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{1 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 4}\frac{x^5}{5} - \cdots$

The transformation between these series involves parameters approximately $(a,b) \approx (0,-\frac{1}{2})$, reflecting the specific curvature properties of these functions.

#### Rational Functions

For rational functions:
- $f(x) = \frac{x}{1-x} = x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots$
- $g(x) = \frac{x}{1+x} = x - x^2 + x^3 - \cdots$

These alternating coefficients are related through parameters $(a,b) \approx (0,-1)$.

#### Laguerre Polynomials

The generalized Laguerre polynomials $L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)$ have the EGF:
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} L_n^{(\alpha)}(x) \frac{t^n}{n!} = \frac{e^{-xt/(1-t)}}{(1-t)^{\alpha+1}}$$

Their connection to generalized Stirling numbers comes through the umbral calculus, where:
$$L_n^{(\alpha)}(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n+\alpha}{n-k} \frac{(-x)^k}{k!}$$

This expansion can be interpreted using generalized Stirling numbers with parameters $(a,b)$ depending on $\alpha$.

#### Touchard Polynomials

Touchard polynomials $T_n(x)$ are a direct special case of the generalized Stirling transform:

- $T_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} S(n,k) x^k$, where $S(n,k)$ are the classical Stirling numbers of the second kind.
- Classical Stirling numbers of the second kind correspond to generalized Stirling numbers with parameters $(a,b) = (0,1)$, so $T_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} S_{n,k}(0,1) x^k$.
- This means Touchard polynomials are a linear combination of powers of $x$, with coefficients encoding the combinatorial structure of set partitions.

The Touchard polynomials are closely related to the Bell numbers, as $T_n(1) = B_n$, where $B_n$ is the $n$-th Bell number. They also appear in the theory of exponential generating functions and have applications in combinatorics, particularly in counting the number of ways to partition sets with certain properties.

This connection highlights a fundamental link: the combinatorial structure that generates the Touchard polynomials is equivalent to the combinatorial structure of generalized Stirling numbers with these specific parameters.

#### Bell Polynomials

The complete Bell polynomials $B_n(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ have a more complex relationship with generalized Stirling numbers, especially in the context of power series composition:

- $B_n(1!a_1, 2!a_2, \ldots, n!a_n) = n! \sum_{k=0}^{n} S_{n,k}(a,b) \frac{a_k}{k!}$
- Here, $B_n(\dots)$ are partial Bell polynomials, representing partitions of a set with each block assigned a specific weight.
- The generalized Stirling numbers act as a transformation matrix, converting the coefficients of one EGF (the sequence $\{a_n\}$) into the sequence of Bell polynomial values.
- The parameters $(a,b)$ are not fixed; they depend on the specific sequence $\{a_n\}$ being transformed.

This framework provides a powerful tool for analyzing the combinatorial properties of a wide variety of sequences through the lens of Bell polynomials and generalized Stirling numbers, and can be used to unify and generalize results in the last few sections.

For example, the Touchard polynomial $T_n(x)$ can be expressed in terms of generalized Stirling numbers as:
$$T_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} S_{n,k}(0,1) x^k$$

This connection highlights how the generalized Stirling framework unifies different polynomial families through parameter-dependent transformations.

#### Bell Polynomials

The complete Bell polynomials $B_n(1!a_1, 2!a_2, \ldots, n!a_n)$ can be connected to generalized Stirling numbers through:
$$B_n(1!a_1, 2!a_2, \ldots, n!a_n) = n! \sum_{k=0}^{n} S_{n,k}(a,b) \frac{a_k}{k!}$$

for specific values of $(a,b)$ that depend on the sequence $\{a_n\}$.
$$[g^{-1}(x)]^{\underline{n}} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} s_{n,k}(a,b) [f^{-1}(x)]^k$$

where $s_{n,k}(a,b)$ are the generalized Stirling numbers of the first kind.

This approach provides a systematic way to determine the parameter $b$ that makes two EGFs functionally inverse through the lens of generalized Stirling transformations.
