# The Hasse-Stirling Framework: A Unified Approach to Special Function Computation

## Article Outline for Submission to [Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics]

### Abstract

This paper presents the Hasse-Stirling framework, a novel approach combining the Hasse operator with generalized Stirling numbers to provide both theoretical insights and computational advantages for evaluating special functions. We demonstrate significant computational improvements for zeta values, Stieltjes constants, and digamma function roots, and extend the framework to several additional special functions. Our approach offers systematic derivation of asymptotic expansions with improved convergence properties, providing both theoretical understanding and practical numerical benefits.
