# Generalized Stirling Transfer Coefficients

A unified framework for polynomial basis transformations using generalized factorial polynomials and their associated transfer coefficients.

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive mathematical framework for **Generalized Stirling Transfer Coefficients** $S_{m,n}(a,b)$, which provide a unified approach to transformations between different polynomial bases. These coefficients generalize the classical Stirling numbers of both kinds and enable systematic conversion between polynomial representations including monomials, rising factorials, falling factorials, and their generalizations.

## Key Features

- **Unified Framework**: Single notation $P(x,a,m)$ encompasses monomials, rising factorials, falling factorials
- **Classical Extensions**: Generalizes Stirling numbers of first and second kinds, Lah numbers
- **Matrix Theory**: Complete matrix representations and inversion relationships
- **Combinatorial Interpretations**: Extends classical counting problems to weighted scenarios
- **Computational Tools**: Efficient algorithms and verification methods
