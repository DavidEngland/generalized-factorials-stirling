# Generalized Stirling Transfer Coefficients

A unified framework for polynomial basis transformations using generalized factorial polynomials and their associated transfer coefficients.

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive mathematical framework for **Generalized Stirling Transfer Coefficients** $S_{m,n}(a,b)$, which provide a unified approach to transformations between different polynomial bases. These coefficients generalize the classical Stirling numbers of both kinds and enable systematic conversion between polynomial representations including monomials, rising factorials, falling factorials, and their generalizations.

## Major Mathematical Result

### General Form Discovery

**The main theoretical breakthrough**: Every generalized Stirling transfer coefficient can be expressed using only classical Stirling numbers:

$$\boxed{S_{m,n}(a,b) = \sum_{k=0}^{\min(m,n)} \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{m-k} \left(\frac{-1}{b}\right)^{n-k} \left\{\begin{array}{c}m\\k\end{array}\right\} \left[\begin{array}{c}n\\k\end{array}\right]}$$

This formula shows that every transformation can be computed as a matrix decomposition $AB^{-1}$ where:
- Matrix $A$ contains Stirling numbers of the second kind with scaling
- Matrix $B^{-1}$ contains unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind with scaling
