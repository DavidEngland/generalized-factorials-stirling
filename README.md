# Generalized Factorials and Stirling Numbers

This repository contains research materials and documentation for a comprehensive study of generalized factorials and their relationship to Stirling numbers, intended as preparatory work for a Wikipedia article.

## Overview

This project explores the mathematical foundations and applications of generalized factorials and their connections to various forms of Stirling numbers, including:

- Classical Stirling numbers of the first and second kind
- Generalized Stirling numbers
- Rising and falling factorials
- Pochhammer symbols
- Applications in combinatorics and special functions
