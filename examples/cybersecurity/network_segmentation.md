# Network Segmentation Using Generalized Stirling Numbers

This case study demonstrates how generalized Stirling numbers can be applied to optimize network segmentation strategies during incident response.

## Problem Statement

A corporate network with `n` hosts has been compromised by malware that has spread to multiple systems. The security team needs to:

1. Contain the infection by segmenting the network into `k` isolated subnetworks
2. Minimize the total cost of remediation and segmentation

## Mathematical Formulation

We can model this problem using generalized Stirling numbers $S_{n,k}(a,b)$ where:

- **n**: Total number of infected hosts
- **k**: Number of isolated subnetworks to create
- **a (Affinity Cost)**: Cost per host to clean and sever existing connections to the malware network
- **b (Barrier Cost)**: Cost to install firewalls/VPNs to create a separate network segment

The total cost of the optimal segmentation strategy is represented by $S_{n,k}(a,b)$.

## Cost Model Parameters

Different enterprises will have different cost structures:

| Environment Type | Affinity Cost (a) | Barrier Cost (b) | Interpretation |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Cloud-native     | Low (1-2)         | Low (2-3)        | Easy to clean VMs and create virtual network boundaries |
| Hybrid           | Medium (3-5)      | Medium (5-8)     | Mix of virtual and physical systems, moderate segmentation cost |
| Legacy/On-prem   | High (8-10)       | High (10-15)     | Difficult to clean systems, expensive physical network changes |

## Example Scenario

Consider a medium-sized enterprise with:
- 20 infected hosts (n=20)
- Need to create 4 isolated network segments (k=4)
- Hybrid environment with:
  - Affinity cost a=4 (cost to clean each host)
  - Barrier cost b=6 (cost to create each network boundary)

### Calculating Optimal Segmentation Cost

The generalized Stirling number $S_{20,4}(4,6)$ represents the total cost of all possible ways to partition 20 infected hosts into 4 secure segments.

Using the recurrence relation for generalized Stirling numbers:

$$S_{n,k}(a,b) = S_{n-1,k-1}(a,b) + (a(n-1) + bk)S_{n-1,k}(a,b)$$

We can calculate this value:

```python
# Example calculation using dynamic programming
def generalized_stirling(n, k, a, b):
    # Create table for memoization
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(k+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]
    
    # Base cases
    dp[0][0] = 1
    
    # Fill table using recurrence relation
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, min(i+1, k+1)):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (a*(i-1) + b*j) * dp[i-1][j]
    
    return dp[n][k]

# Calculate optimal segmentation cost
total_cost = generalized_stirling(20, 4, 4, 6)
print(f"Total cost of optimal segmentation: {total_cost}")
```

## Strategic Insights

The generalized Stirling framework provides several insights:

1. **Trade-off Analysis**: If $a \gg b$ (cleaning hosts is much costlier than creating segments), the optimal strategy tends toward creating more segments with fewer hosts per segment.

2. **Sensitivity Analysis**: By varying parameters, we can see how the total cost changes:
   - If $a$ increases (e.g., hosts with sensitive data requiring forensic analysis): Consider creating more segments
   - If $b$ increases (e.g., compliance requirements for segment boundaries): Consider fewer, larger segments

3. **Comparative Strategies**:

| Strategy | Parameter Values | Total Cost | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------------------|------------|------|------|
| Many small segments | a=4, b=2, k=8 | Lower a×n component | Better containment | Higher b×k component |
| Few large segments | a=4, b=10, k=2 | Lower b×k component | Simpler architecture | Higher risk of spread |
| Balanced approach | a=4, b=6, k=4 | Optimized total cost | Balance of concerns | Requires careful planning |

## Visualization
