## Implementation Guidelines

Each example should include:

1. **Problem Statement**: Clear description of the problem being solved
2. **Mathematical Formulation**: How generalized Stirling numbers apply to this problem
3. **Parameter Interpretation**: Physical or conceptual meaning of $(a,b)$ in this context
4. **Implementation**: Well-documented code with:
   - Parameter estimation methods
   - Core computation algorithm
   - Visualization or result presentation
5. **Validation**: Method to verify the model produces realistic results
6. **Extension**: Suggestions for how the example could be extended or modified

## Dual Perspectives

When appropriate, examples should illustrate both constructive and deconstructive ("inverse") perspectives:

- **Constructive**: Building structures from individual elements (classical approach)
- **Deconstructive**: Breaking down complex systems into simpler components

This dual approach highlights the versatility of the generalized Stirling framework.

## Technologies

Examples are implemented using:

- **Python**: Primary language with NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, networkx
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive demonstrations and visualizations
- **Web Applications**: For user-friendly interactive examples
- **LaTeX**: For mathematical documentation and theory explanation
