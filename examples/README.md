# Examples Directory

This directory contains computational examples and illustrations of generalized Stirling numbers.

## Planned Content

- Numerical computations of specific values
- Visualization of patterns and relationships
- Comparison with classical Stirling numbers
- Applications to combinatorial problems
- Interactive examples and demonstrations

## Tools and Languages

Examples may be implemented in:

- Python (with NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib)
- Mathematica/Wolfram Language
- SageMath
- Julia
- LaTeX for static mathematical illustrations

## Organization

Examples should be well-documented with:

- Clear descriptions of what is being computed or demonstrated
- Mathematical background and context
- Code comments explaining the implementation
- Output interpretation and significance
