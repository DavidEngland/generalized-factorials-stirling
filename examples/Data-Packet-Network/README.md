# Network Resource Allocation: Multivariate Moment Analysis for Server Distribution

This example demonstrates how multivariate polynomial moment analysis can optimize the routing of data packets in a decentralized network, balancing processing efficiency and infrastructure costs.

## Advanced Methodology

This implementation applies multivariate Bell polynomials to:

- **Extract multidimensional feature patterns** with high precision
- **Determine optimal resource distribution** through structural coefficient analysis
- **Model complex feature interactions** using higher-order moment refinements
- **Adapt to non-uniform traffic patterns** through partition structure identification

## Scenario

In a distributed network, incoming data packets must be assigned to processing servers. The system must balance routing packets to existing servers (for efficiency) versus creating new servers (with associated infrastructure costs).

- **Cohesion Coefficient (a):** Measures the system's tendency to consolidate similar traffic on existing servers.
- **Separation Coefficient (b):** Represents the threshold for establishing new infrastructure.

## How to Run
