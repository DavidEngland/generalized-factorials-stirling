# Data Packet Network Demo: Bell-Enhanced Stirling Partitioning for Decentralized Routing

This example demonstrates how the Bell-Enhanced Stirling Partitioning Algorithm can be applied to model the routing of data packets in a decentralized computer network, balancing clustering efficiency and the cost of creating new servers.

## Advanced Bell Polynomial Methodology

This demo implements multivariate Bell polynomials to:

- Handle multidimensional feature spaces more effectively
- Estimate optimal server counts with greater precision
- Capture complex interdependencies between packet features
- Provide higher-order corrections to standard clustering

## Scenario

In a distributed network, each incoming data packet must be assigned to a server for processing. The network can either route the packet to an existing server (clustering for efficiency) or create a new server (incurring a setup cost).

- **Affinity (Parameter a):** Measures the network's tendency to route packets to existing servers, optimizing for efficiency and resource utilization.
- **Barrier (Parameter b):** Represents the cost of establishing a new server, including hardware, energy, and setup time.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn sympy
   ```
