##  Asymptotic Expansions for Stieltjes Constants

The approach used for the digamma roots can be extended to the Stieltjes constants $\gamma_k$, which appear in the Laurent expansion of the Hurwitz zeta function:

$$
\zeta(s, a) = \frac{1}{s-1} + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \gamma_k(a) (s-1)^k
$$

### Hasse-Stirling Representation

The Stieltjes constants admit a Hasse-Stirling representation:

$$
\gamma_k(a) = -\frac{1}{k+1} \mathcal{H}_{\frac{k+3}{2}, -\frac{k+4}{2}, 0}(\log(t)^{k+1})(a)
$$

### Asymptotic Expansion Strategy

To derive an asymptotic expansion for $\gamma_k(a)$:

1. **Start with the Hasse-Stirling operator form** for $\gamma_k(a)$.
2. **Expand $\log(t)^{k+1}$** in terms of its Taylor or asymptotic series.
3. **Apply the recurrence relations** for generalized Stirling numbers to generate correction terms.
4. **Invert the resulting series** using formal power series techniques, similar to the digamma case.
5. **Express the expansion in terms of powers of $1/a$** for large $a$.

### Example (Leading Term)

For large $a$, the leading term is:

$$
\gamma_k(a) \sim \frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \frac{\log^{k+1}(a)}{a}
$$

Higher-order corrections involve inverse powers of $a$ and derivatives of $\log^{k+1}(a)$, with coefficients determined by the Hasse-Stirling recurrence.

### General Form

The general asymptotic expansion for large $a$ is:

$$
\gamma_k(a) \sim \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \frac{c_{k,j}}{a^j} \log^{k+1-j}(a)
$$

where $c_{k,j}$ are coefficients computable via the Hasse-Stirling framework.

### Stepping Down from Large $a$ to Smaller $a$

The Hasse-Stirling representation
$$
\gamma_k(a) = -\frac{1}{k+1} \mathcal{H}_{\frac{k+3}{2}, -\frac{k+4}{2}, 0}(\log(t)^{k+1})(a)
$$
is especially effective for large $a$, where the asymptotic expansion converges rapidly.

To compute $\gamma_k(a)$ for smaller $a$ using the large-$a$ expansion:

1. **Compute $\gamma_k(A)$ for a large $A \gg 1$** using the asymptotic series.
2. **Use the recurrence relation for Stieltjes constants:**
   $$
   \gamma_k(a-1) = \gamma_k(a) + \frac{\log^k(a)}{a}
   $$
   This allows you to "step down" from $A$ to $A-1$, $A-2$, ..., $a$.
3. **Iterate the recurrence:** For each step,
   $$
   \gamma_k(a-m) = \gamma_k(a-(m-1)) + \frac{\log^k(a-m)}{a-m}
   $$
   until you reach the desired smaller $a$.

### Practical Algorithm

- Compute $\gamma_k(A)$ for large $A$ using the Hasse-Stirling asymptotic expansion.
- For $a < A$, recursively apply the recurrence to obtain $\gamma_k(a)$:
  ```python
  def stieltjes_constant_step_down(gamma_k_A, k, A, a):
      """Step down Stieltjes constant from large A to smaller a."""
      gamma = gamma_k_A
      for m in range(A - a):
          x = A - m
          gamma = gamma + (np.log(x)**k) / x
      return gamma
  ```
- This method combines the accuracy of the asymptotic expansion for large $A$ with the exact recurrence for smaller $a$.

### Special Case: $k=0$ (Connection to Digamma Function)

For $k=0$, the Stieltjes constant $\gamma_0(a)$ is related to the digamma function:
\[
\gamma_0(a) = -\psi(a)
\]
where $\psi(a)$ is the digamma function.

**Implication:**  
The asymptotic expansion for $\gamma_0(a)$ is simply the negative of the well-known asymptotic expansion for $\psi(a)$:
\[
\psi(a) \sim \log(a) - \frac{1}{2a} - \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \frac{B_{2j}}{2j\,a^{2j}}
\]
So,
\[
\gamma_0(a) \sim -\log(a) + \frac{1}{2a} + \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \frac{B_{2j}}{2j\,a^{2j}}
\]
where $B_{2j}$ are Bernoulli numbers.

**Practical Note:**  
For $k=0$, you can directly use the algebraic expansion for the digamma function, negated, for rapid and accurate computation of $\gamma_0(a)$ at large $a$.

### Algorithmic Shortcut

- For $k=0$, set $\gamma_0(a) = -\psi(a)$ and use the digamma asymptotic expansion.
- For $k>0$, use the general Hasse-Stirling expansion as described above.

### Notes

- The recurrence is exact and numerically stable for moderate $k$ and $a$.
- For very small $a$, direct computation or alternative series may be preferable.
- This approach is analogous to backward recurrence methods used for special functions.
