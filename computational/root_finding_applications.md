# Advanced Root Finding Applications of the Hasse-Stirling Framework

The remarkable success of the Hasse-Stirling approach in finding asymptotic expansions for digamma roots suggests broader applications to other special functions. This document explores several promising candidates where similar techniques could provide significant computational advantages.

## 1. Bessel Functions

### 1.1 Root Finding for Bessel Functions

The roots of Bessel functions $J_\nu(x)$ are critically important in applications ranging from wave propagation to quantum mechanics.

**Traditional Approach:**
- McMahon's asymptotic expansion for the $n$-th root:
  $$j_{\nu,n} \approx \left(n+\frac{\nu}{2}-\frac{1}{4}\right)\pi - \frac{4\nu^2-1}{8\left(n+\frac{\nu}{2}-\frac{1}{4}\right)\pi} + O\left(\frac{1}{n^3}\right)$$
- Limited accuracy for low orders, requires many terms for high precision

**Hasse-Stirling Potential:**
- The Bessel function can be expressed via Hasse operator:
  $$J_\nu(x) = \frac{(x/2)^\nu}{\Gamma(\nu+1)} \mathcal{H}_{\nu+1,-1,0}(e^{-x^2t/4})(1)$$
- An improved expansion could be derived with the form:
  $$j_{\nu,n} \approx \left(n+\frac{\nu}{2}-\frac{1}{4}\right)\pi - \frac{a_1}{b_1\left(n+\frac{\nu}{2}-\frac{1}{4}\right)} + \frac{a_2}{b_2\left(n+\frac{\nu}{2}-\frac{1}{4}\right)^3} - \cdots$$
  where coefficients follow patterns similar to those found for digamma

**Expected Improvements:**
- Higher accuracy with fewer terms
- Unified treatment for different orders $\nu$
- Better behavior for large $n$ and $\nu$

## 2. Airy Functions

### 2.1 Roots of Ai(x) and Ai'(x)

The roots of Airy functions are essential in diffraction problems, quantum mechanics, and asymptotic analysis.

**Traditional Approach:**
- Approximation via complex analysis and asymptotic series
- Separate treatments for Ai(x) and Ai'(x)

**Hasse-Stirling Potential:**
- Airy functions relate to Bessel functions of order 1/3:
  $$\text{Ai}(x) = \frac{1}{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{x}{3}}K_{1/3}\left(\frac{2}{3}x^{3/2}\right)$$
- Using the Hasse representation of Bessel functions can lead to more unified expansions for Airy roots
- Potential form for the $n$-th negative root of Ai(x):
  $$a_n \approx -\left(\frac{3\pi}{8}(4n-1)\right)^{2/3}\left(1 + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{c_k}{(4n-1)^{2k}}\right)$$
  where $c_k$ coefficients can be derived systematically using Hasse-Stirling methods

**Expected Improvements:**
- More rapid convergence
- Unified treatment of Ai and Ai' roots
- Better handling of higher roots

## 3. Riemann Zeta Function

### 3.1 Non-trivial Zeros

Finding the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ is one of the most important problems in mathematics.

**Traditional Approach:**
- Riemann-Siegel formula and its variants
- Numerically intensive with limited asymptotic understanding

**Hasse-Stirling Potential:**
- Connection through the logarithmic derivatives:
  $$\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}$$
- The Hasse operator can express this in terms of:
  $$\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)} = \mathcal{H}_{s,-1,0}(g(t))(1)$$
  for a suitable function $g(t)$
- Potential for improved asymptotic formulas for the $n$-th zero:
  $$\rho_n = \frac{1}{2} + it_n$$
  where $t_n$ has an expansion using Hasse-Stirling techniques

**Expected Improvements:**
- Better understanding of the distribution of zeros
- More efficient computation of high zeros
- Potentially new insights into the Riemann Hypothesis

## 4. Lambert W Function

### 4.1 Branches and Singularities

The Lambert W function $W(z)$ satisfies $W(z)e^{W(z)} = z$ and has applications in combinatorics, physics, and delay differential equations.

**Traditional Approach:**
- Series expansions around regular points
- Separate treatments for different branches
- Asymptotic expansions with limited convergence

**Hasse-Stirling Potential:**
- Direct representation using Hasse operator:
  $$W(z) = \mathcal{H}_{1,-1,0}(\log(t))(\log(z))$$
- Potential for unified expansions across branch points
- Especially effective near the branch point at $z = -1/e$

**Expected Improvements:**
- Better numerical stability near branch points
- Unified treatment of multiple branches
- Improved convergence for asymptotic expansions

## 5. Hypergeometric Functions

### 5.1 Zeros of $_pF_q$ Functions

Hypergeometric functions $_pF_q$ generalize many special functions and their zeros are important in numerous applications.

**Traditional Approach:**
- Typically numerical methods like Newton-Raphson
- Limited asymptotic understanding for general parameters

**Hasse-Stirling Potential:**
- Direct representation using Hasse operators:
  $$_2F_1(a,b;c;z) = \mathcal{H}_{a,c-a-b,0}\left(\frac{1}{(1-zt)^b}\right)(1)$$
- Can derive asymptotic expansions for zeros based on parameter values

**Expected Improvements:**
- Systematic approach to different parameter regimes
- Better accuracy for extreme parameter values
- Reduced computational cost for high-precision calculations

## 6. Polygamma Functions

### 6.1 Higher-Order Digamma Derivatives

The polygamma functions $\psi^{(m)}(x)$ are higher derivatives of the digamma function and appear in many applications.

**Traditional Approach:**
- Limited asymptotic understanding of zeros
- Often treated with generic numerical methods

**Hasse-Stirling Potential:**
- Direct extension of digamma techniques:
  $$\psi^{(m)}(x) = (-1)^{m+1}m!\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(x+k)^{m+1}}$$
- The Hasse representation follows naturally from digamma
- For $\psi^{(m)}(x) = 0$, similar patterns of coefficients likely emerge

**Expected Improvements:**
- Unified treatment across different orders $m$
- High precision for large-index roots
- Systematic derivation of asymptotic coefficients

## 7. Incomplete Gamma Functions

### 7.1 Roots of $\gamma(a,x)$ and $\Gamma(a,x)$

Incomplete gamma functions appear in probability, statistics, and differential equations.

**Traditional Approach:**
- Typically numerical methods
- Limited asymptotic understanding

**Hasse-Stirling Potential:**
- Connection through the Hasse operator representation:
  $$\gamma(a,x) = \int_0^x t^{a-1}e^{-t}dt = x^a\mathcal{H}_{a,-1,0}(e^{-xt})(1)$$
- Potential for asymptotic expansion of roots with respect to parameter $a$

**Expected Improvements:**
- Better handling of extreme parameter values
- Improved convergence rates
- Systematic treatment of different root types

### 7.2 Connection to Generalized Stieltjes Constants

A profound and previously underexplored connection exists between the incomplete gamma function and the generalized Stieltjes constants through the Hasse-Stirling framework:

1. **Unified Representation**: Both functions can be expressed using the Hasse operator:
   - Incomplete gamma: $\gamma(a,x) = x^a\mathcal{H}_{a,-1,0}(e^{-xt})(1)$
   - Generalized Stieltjes: $\gamma_k(a) = -\frac{1}{k+1}\mathcal{H}_{\frac{k+3}{2},-\frac{k+4}{2},0}(\log(t)^{k+1})(a)$

2. **Integral Transform Relationship**: The generalized Stieltjes constants $\gamma_k(a)$ appear in the Laurent expansion of the Hurwitz zeta function:
   $$\zeta(s,a) = \frac{1}{s-1} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \gamma_n(a) (s-1)^n$$

   While the Hurwitz zeta function relates to the gamma function through:
   $$\zeta(s,a) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int_0^{\infty} \frac{t^{s-1}e^{-at}}{1-e^{-t}}dt$$

3. **Asymptotic Behavior Connection**: For large values of the parameter $a$, the generalized Stieltjes constants $\gamma_k(a)$ can be expressed using incomplete gamma functions:
   $$\gamma_k(a) \sim \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\left[\frac{\gamma(k+1,a\log a)}{a} - \log^{k+1}(a)\right] + \text{lower order terms}$$

4. **Root Finding Applications**: This connection enables a unified approach to finding:
   - Roots of $\gamma(a,x) = c$ (incomplete gamma equals constant)
   - Values of $a$ where $\gamma_k(a) = 0$ (zeros of generalized Stieltjes constants)

5. **Computational Advantage**: The Hasse-Stirling approach provides significantly improved asymptotic expansions for both functions, especially in regions where:
   - Traditional methods suffer from cancellation errors
   - Parameters become large
   - Multiple roots need to be calculated efficiently

This previously unexplored connection not only deepens our theoretical understanding but also offers practical computational benefits for both functions.

## 8. Implementation Considerations

The implementation of these improved root-finding techniques would follow similar patterns to the digamma case:

1. Express the target function in terms of the Hasse operator
2. Apply the recurrence relations for generalized Stirling numbers
3. Use asymptotic matching to derive coefficients
4. Implement efficient computation based on the resulting expansions

Each function requires specific parameter optimizations, but the underlying mathematical structure remains consistent across applications, demonstrating the universality of the Hasse-Stirling framework.

## 9. Conclusion

The Hasse-Stirling approach to root finding offers significant potential improvements across many special functions. The key advantages include:

1. Higher precision with fewer terms
2. Unified treatment of related functions
3. Better numerical stability in challenging regions
4. Systematic derivation of asymptotic coefficients
5. Insights into mathematical structures through coefficient patterns

Future work should focus on systematically deriving these expansions and implementing them in computational libraries to benefit practical applications in science and engineering.
