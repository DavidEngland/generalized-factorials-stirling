## Development Philosophy Demonstrated

This project exemplifies rigorous mathematical development:

1. **Systematic exploration** leading to breakthrough general form
2. **Matrix decomposition insight** revealing underlying structure  
3. **Multiple verification methods** for all claims
4. **Clean abandonment** of failed approaches (T-coefficients)
5. **Proper mathematical notation** throughout
6. **Preparation for future research** and implementation

The repository now provides a complete, verified framework for generalized Stirling transfer coefficients, with the general form as the crowning theoretical achievement.
