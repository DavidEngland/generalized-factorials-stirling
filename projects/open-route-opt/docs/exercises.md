# Stirling Measure Exercises

The following exercises will help you gain practical experience working with the Stirling Measure for parameter estimation. These exercises range from basic to advanced and cover various application domains.

## Basic Exercises

### Exercise 1: Manual Calculation

Calculate the Stirling Measure for the following simple case:
- n = 5 (elements)
- k = 2 (groups)
- S(5,2) = 15
- S(6,2) = 31
- S(5,1) = 1

Use the formula: (S(n+1,k) - S(n,k-1)) / S(n,k)

### Exercise 2: Parameter Estimation from Two Points

Given the following Stirling Measures:
- For (n=10, k=3): Measure = 7.2
- For (n=15, k=5): Measure = 10.5

Set up and solve the system of equations to find parameters a and b.

### Exercise 3: Data Visualization

Using the provided notebook template, generate a synthetic dataset with a=0.3 and b=1.5. Create a 3D visualization showing how the Stirling Measure varies with n and k.

## Intermediate Exercises

### Exercise 4: Cross-Validation

Implement a cross-validation approach for parameter estimation:
1. Generate a synthetic dataset with known parameters
2. Split into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets
3. Estimate parameters from the training set
4. Evaluate prediction accuracy on the validation set
5. Report the mean squared error

### Exercise 5: Application to NYC Taxi Data

Using the NYC Taxi dataset:
1. Group pickups by hour and neighborhood
2. Count how many taxis (k) serve how many passengers (n) in each period
3. Calculate the Stirling Measure for each observation
4. Estimate parameters a and b
5. Interpret what these parameters reveal about taxi service patterns

### Exercise 6: Confidence Intervals

Enhance the parameter estimation by:
1. Using bootstrap sampling to generate multiple estimates
2. Calculating 95% confidence intervals for parameters a and b
3. Visualizing the distribution of parameter estimates

## Advanced Exercises

### Exercise 7: Time-Varying Parameters

Investigate how parameters a and b might change over time:
1. Slice the NYC Taxi data by month
2. Estimate parameters for each month separately
3. Plot the evolution of parameters over time
4. Identify seasonal patterns or trends

### Exercise 8: Multi-Parameter Model

Extend the model to include more parameters:
1. Define a generalized model with parameter c: (S(n+1,k) - S(n,k-1)) / S(n,k) = an + bk + c
2. Implement the parameter estimation for this extended model
3. Test if the additional parameter improves prediction accuracy

### Exercise 9: Real-World Optimization

Apply the Stirling Measure to a real-world optimization problem:
1. Collect or generate data for a domain of your choice
2. Estimate the parameters using the Stirling Measure
3. Implement a decision algorithm based on these parameters
4. Compare the performance against a baseline approach
5. Quantify the improvement in terms of relevant metrics

## Project Ideas

### Project 1: E-commerce Customer Segmentation Tool

Build a tool that:
1. Analyzes customer purchase history data
2. Clusters customers based on buying patterns
3. Uses the Stirling Measure to extract the underlying parameters
4. Provides recommendations for targeted marketing strategies

### Project 2: Dynamic Route Planning System

Create a system that:
1. Takes real-time delivery requests
2. Uses historically derived parameters a and b
3. Makes optimal decisions about route assignments
4. Adapts parameters as new data becomes available
5. Visualizes routes and performance metrics

### Project 3: Comparative Study

Conduct a study comparing the Stirling Measure approach to traditional clustering algorithms:
1. Select 3-5 datasets from different domains
2. Apply both the Stirling Measure and traditional methods (k-means, hierarchical clustering)
3. Compare results in terms of quality, computational efficiency, and interpretability
4. Document findings in a research-style paper
