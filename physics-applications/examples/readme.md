# Spin Chain Model with Hasse-Stirling Framework

This project simulates a one-dimensional spin chain using the **Hasse-Stirling framework**, a mathematical approach that goes beyond traditional Hamiltonian formulations. Instead of relying solely on standard energy terms, the model incorporates three key parameters‚Äî**Œ±**, **Œ≤**, and **r**‚Äîto capture both conventional physical interactions and higher-order corrections.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The simulation is built around the `HasseStirlingSpin` class, which manages all calculations and state enumeration.

### Physical Parameters

Each Hasse-Stirling parameter has a direct physical interpretation:

- **$-\alpha$ (Affinity/Cohesion):** Represents nearest-neighbor coupling between spins.
  - **Negative Œ±** (i.e., positive $-\alpha$): **Ferromagnetic** behavior‚Äîadjacent spins prefer to align (like the standard Ising model).
  - **Positive Œ±** (i.e., negative $-\alpha$): **Antiferromagnetic** behavior‚Äîadjacent spins prefer to be anti-aligned.
- **$\beta$ (Barrier):** Models the energy cost of creating a "domain wall" (a boundary between regions of different spin orientation). This is a form of magnetic anisotropy.
- **$r$ (External Bias):** Represents an external magnetic field favoring one spin orientation.

### Mathematical Framework

The model uses **generalized Stirling numbers** and **Hasse coefficients**:

- **`generalized_stirling()`:** Computes a modified version of Stirling numbers of the second kind, adapted for physical modeling.
- **`hasse_coefficient()`:** Calculates Hasse coefficients, derived from the generalized Stirling numbers. These coefficients introduce higher-order corrections to the system's energy, moving beyond mean-field approximations.

### Simulation Steps

1. **State Generation:** All possible spin configurations for a chain of length $L$ are generated (e.g., $2^6 = 64$ states for $L=6$). This is an exact enumeration, so computational cost grows exponentially with chain length.
2. **Energy Calculation:** For each configuration, the total energy is computed:
    - **Base Energy:** Standard contributions from nearest-neighbor interactions, barriers, and external field.
    - **Hasse Energy Correction:** Additional terms based on Hasse coefficients, representing more complex interactions.
3. **Statistical Mechanics:** With all state energies known, the code computes:
    - **Partition Function ($Z$):** Sum over all states, weighted by temperature.
    - **Magnetization ($\langle M \rangle$):** Average spin alignment, indicating magnetic phase.
    - **Correlation ($\langle s_i s_{i+1} \rangle$):** Average alignment of adjacent spins, measuring order.
4. **Phase Diagrams:** By varying **Œ±** and **Œ≤**, the code plots magnetization and correlation, visualizing transitions between magnetic phases (e.g., ordered ferromagnetic to disordered).

## üìä Sample Results

The `main()` function demonstrates the model's capabilities:

- **Phase Diagrams:** Shows magnetization and nearest-neighbor correlation across different values of **Œ±** and **Œ≤**.
- **Correction Comparison:** Plots magnetization curves with and without Hasse-Stirling corrections, illustrating their impact.
- **Physical Cases:** Calculates key quantities for standard scenarios (ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, external field, critical point).

Plots such as `spin_chain_phase_diagram.png` and `hasse_stirling_comparison.png` help visualize how the parameters affect the system's physical properties.

## üìù Notes

- The model is idealized and best suited for small chains due to exponential scaling.
- Negative Œ± corresponds to ferromagnetic coupling; positive Œ± to antiferromagnetic.
- The Hasse-Stirling corrections provide a way to systematically include higher-order effects, potentially improving accuracy over mean-field models.
- The framework is flexible and can be extended to more complex systems or used to explore parameter regimes relevant to condensed matter physics.
