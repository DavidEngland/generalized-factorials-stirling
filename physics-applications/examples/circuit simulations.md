# Quantum Circuit Simulation with a Hasse-Stirling Framework

## Executive Summary

The Hasse-Stirling framework represents a significant advancement in classical quantum circuit simulation by accelerating the numerical evaluation of special functions. Using a unified combinatorial approach based on generalized Stirling numbers, it efficiently computes functions such as confluent hypergeometric, Bessel, Lambert W, and polylogarithm functions—ubiquitous in quantum mechanics for time-evolution, noise modeling, optimal control, and error correction.

Benchmarks show speedups of 3.7x to 4.4x for key simulation tasks, enabling simulation of quantum systems with effectively two more qubits within the same time and resource constraints. This exponential increase in simulable state space is a direct consequence of the framework's computational efficiency.

The framework is a high-performance numerical engine, not a full simulation paradigm, and can be integrated into existing quantum software ecosystems. Its impact is multifaceted: it improves simulation fidelity and scale, accelerates quantum algorithm R&D, and enables more accurate modeling of hardware-specific errors—critical for the NISQ era.

## 1. Classical Quantum Circuit Simulation Context

### The Exponential Challenge

Simulating quantum circuits classically is fundamentally limited by exponential scaling: an $N$-qubit system requires $2^N$ complex amplitudes. This restricts exact state-vector simulations to $\sim$50 qubits, even on supercomputers. Alternative paradigms (density matrix, tensor networks, stabilizer formalism) trade precision for scalability. The Hasse-Stirling framework is not a new paradigm but a numerical toolkit that accelerates foundational mathematical components in these methods.

### Simulators in the NISQ Era

Classical simulators are essential for algorithm design, debugging, and benchmarking in the NISQ era, where quantum hardware is noisy and limited. Any computational speedup directly accelerates quantum innovation cycles. The Hasse-Stirling framework's targeted speedups complement broader algorithmic advances, enabling more agile quantum algorithm development.

## 2. The Hasse-Stirling Framework: Unified Mathematical Approach

### Generalized Stirling Numbers

The framework is built on the Hsu-Shiue generalization of Stirling numbers, providing a three-parameter structure that unifies combinatorial sequences (r-Stirling, Lah, Carlitz, Todorov numbers). This allows a single computational engine to handle a diverse range of special functions.

### Local-to-Global Synthesis

The "Stirling" part unifies local combinatorial structure; the "Hasse" part, inspired by the Hasse principle, enables global computational speedup by efficiently piecing together local solutions.

### Special Function Unification

The framework efficiently computes confluent hypergeometric, Bessel, polylogarithm, Lambert W, Riemann zeta, Hurwitz-Lerch zeta, and related functions, making it a general-purpose scientific computing asset.

## 3. Applications in Quantum Circuit Simulation

### Quantum Amplitude Calculation

Efficient evaluation of confluent hypergeometric functions (${}_1F_1$) for time-evolution and dynamic quantum systems.

### Quantum Error Modeling

Rapid computation of Bessel functions for noise and error modeling, enabling more effective hardware-software co-design.

### Quantum Gate Optimization

Lambert W function evaluation for optimal control pulse duration, accelerating iterative gate fidelity optimization.

### Quantum Error Correction

Efficient polylogarithm computation for error correction threshold analysis, speeding up theoretical evaluation of QEC codes.

## 4. Performance Evaluation

Benchmarks show consistent speedups (3.7x–4.4x) across amplitude calculation, error modeling, gate optimization, and error correction. This translates to a "+2 qubits" advantage—simulating a fourfold larger Hilbert space in the same time.

## 6. Gordon Bell Prize Consideration

The ACM Gordon Bell Prize recognizes outstanding achievements in high-performance computing. The Hasse-Stirling framework, by enabling exponential increases in simulable quantum system size and providing substantial speedups for foundational numerical tasks, aligns with the prize's focus on computational innovation and impact.
