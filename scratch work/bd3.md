Perfect 👍 — for GitHub README-style Markdown, you need syntax that:
	•	Doesn’t depend on MathJax or LaTeX rendering, since GitHub Markdown does not natively render TeX math.
	•	Still looks professional and readable, with equations shown as plain text (using backticks or Unicode symbols).
	•	Avoids parse errors from $, \, and nested parentheses.

Here’s your cleaned-up, GitHub-safe version — no LaTeX delimiters, no inline $...$, and ready to drop into a README or Markdown doc:

Why arcoth, artanh, ln, Log, and Complex Transformations Matter

1. Unified Structure: Hyperbolic Inverses and Logarithms

The inverse hyperbolic functions arcoth(x) and artanh(x) are fundamentally logarithmic:

arcoth(x) = (1/2) * ln((x + 1) / (x - 1))
artanh(x) = (1/2) * ln((1 + x) / (1 - x))

The natural logarithm ln(x) and its complex extension Log(z) form the analytic backbone for these functions.

2. Complex Transformations: Link to Trigonometric Functions

Through complex substitution, hyperbolic and trigonometric functions are connected:

artanh(i·x) = i·arctan(x)
arcoth(i·x) = i·arccot(x)

The logarithmic definitions extend naturally to the complex plane, bridging hyperbolic and circular (trigonometric) inverses.

⸻

3. Series Representations

Both artanh(x) and arcoth(x) admit simple power series:

artanh(x) = Σ (x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)),   |x| < 1
arcoth(x) = Σ (x^-(2n+1) / (2n+1)),  |x| > 1

These series correspond directly to those for arctan(x) and arccot(x) under the substitution x → i·x.

⸻

4. Connection to Exponential and Bernoulli Numbers

The hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of the exponential function:

sinh(x) = (e^x - e^-x) / 2
cosh(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / 2

The expansions of cot(x) and coth(x) involve Bernoulli numbers B₂n:

x·cot(x)  = 1 - 2 Σ [(-1)^n * B₂n / (2n)!] * (2x)^(2n)
x·coth(x) = 1 + 2 Σ [ B₂n / (2n)! ] * (2x)^(2n)

By applying Lagrange inversion, one obtains the corresponding series for arccot(x) and arcoth(x), with coefficients expressed in terms of Bernoulli numbers and even zeta values.

5. Analytic Continuation and Branch Cuts

Using Log(z) and complex arguments enables analytic continuation of these functions, where the branch cuts and principal values are governed by the underlying logarithmic and square-root structure.

This is essential in complex analysis, physics, and number theory, where continuity across domains is crucial.

	•	These identities unify hyperbolic, trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions.
	•	They provide practical tools for series expansions, special values, and analytic continuation.
	•	Bernoulli numbers and zeta values encode deep arithmetic and combinatorial properties.
	•	Applications span analysis, number theory, mathematical physics, and engineering.

8. The Logarithm via Inverse Hyperbolic Functions

The natural logarithm ln(x) (and complex Log(z)) can be expressed using inverse hyperbolic functions:

ln(x) = artanh((x² - 1) / (x² + 1))
      = arsinh((x² - 1) / (2x))
      = arcoth((x² + 1) / (x² - 1))

For any real or complex x, there exists a unique “angle” (hyperbolic or circular) associated with x through these inverses.

The choice of function depends on the magnitude of x:
	•	If |x| < 1, use artanh(x).
	•	If |x| > 1, use arcoth(x).

A key identity unifying the two is:

artanh(x) = arcoth(1 / x),   for x ≠ 0

This provides analytic continuation across all regions.

⸻

Summary
	•	The logarithm and its extensions can be constructed from inverse hyperbolic functions.
	•	Each real or complex number corresponds to a unique hyperbolic angle.
	•	The reciprocal relation between artanh(x) and arcoth(1/x) provides a unified analytic bridge between domains.
