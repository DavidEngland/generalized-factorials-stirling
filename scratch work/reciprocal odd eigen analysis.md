Nice — here are concrete ways to build and play with systems whose eigenvalues are exactly the reciprocals of the odd integers
\{\;1,\tfrac13,\tfrac15,\dots\;\}, plus a small numerical demonstration.

Quick overview / math facts
	•	The easiest (and mathematically trivial) example is the diagonal operator on \ell^2:
T : \ell^2 \to \ell^2,\qquad T(e_n)=\frac{1}{2n+1}\,e_n.
This is bounded, self-adjoint, compact (since eigenvalues \to0), Hilbert–Schmidt (because \sum 1/(2n+1)^2<\infty), but not trace-class because \sum 1/(2n+1)=\infty.
	•	Using the spectral theorem you can turn that diagonal model into a concrete integral operator on L^2[0,1].
Choose any orthonormal basis \{\varphi_n\}{n\ge0} of L^2[0,1] (for example \varphi_n(x)=\sqrt{2}\sin((n+1)\pi x)), then define the Mercer kernel
K(x,y)=\sum{n\ge0}\frac{1}{2n+1}\,\varphi_n(x)\,\varphi_n(y).
The integral operator (Tf)(x)=\int_0^1 K(x,y)f(y)\,dy is compact, self-adjoint, positive, and has eigenpairs (\lambda_n,\varphi_n) with \lambda_n=1/(2n+1).
	•	Properties:
• Spectrum: discrete eigenvalues \lambda_n\downarrow0, accumulation point only at 0.
• Multiplicity: you can make each eigenvalue simple by choosing distinct \varphi_n.
• Hilbert–Schmidt norm squared: \sum_n \lambda_n^2 = \sum_{n\ge0} 1/(2n+1)^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{8}.
• Not trace-class: \sum_n \lambda_n = \infty.
	•	You can also realize such eigenvalues for finite-dimensional approximations (finite diagonal matrices), or embed them as the singular values of non-self-adjoint operators. For Sturm–Liouville / differential operators you would need to solve an inverse spectral problem — possible in principle but more work to match the exact sequence 1/(2n+1).

Concrete kernel example (explicit)

Take \varphi_n(x)=\sqrt{2}\sin((n+1)\pi x) on [0,1] (orthonormal). Define
K(x,y)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2n+1}\,\varphi_n(x)\varphi_n(y).
Mercer guarantees this series converges in L^2 (indeed uniformly in many senses because \sum\lambda_n^2<\infty), and the integral operator with kernel K has exactly the eigenpairs (\lambda_n,\varphi_n).

Numerical check (I ran a short discretization)

I discretized the integral operator built from the first 100 basis functions on a 400×400 collocation grid and computed eigenvalues of the resulting matrix. The first few numerical eigenvalues match the target values exactly (within floating-point precision). Example (first five):

index	numerical_eig	target_lambda
0	1.000000	1.000000
1	0.333333	0.333333
2	0.200000	0.200000
3	0.142857	0.142857
4	0.111111	0.111111

(If you’d like, I can show you the full table, plots of eigenvalue decay, or export the kernel matrix / eigenvectors.)

Suggestions for further exploration
	1.	If you want an operator on L^2 with the same eigenvalues but different multiplicities or sign patterns, change the signs or repeat eigenvalues when building your diagonal or Mercer kernel.
	2.	Want a differential operator with these eigenvalues? We can attempt an inverse spectral construction (Sturm–Liouville) but it’s a more delicate project — I can sketch steps or attempt a numeric inverse-problem reconstruction.
	3.	Interested in asymptotics / functional calculus? Because \lambda_n\sim 1/(2n) you can compute many operator norms and determine membership in Schatten classes.
	4.	Want a small script to generate finite approximations or visualize eigenfunctions? I can provide ready-to-run code (I already ran a discretization — tell me whether you want a downloadable script/notebook).

Which of these would you like next — more examples (matrices, kernels), plots of eigenvalue decay, an inverse Sturm–Liouville sketch, or the full numerical table and eigenfunctions? ￼
