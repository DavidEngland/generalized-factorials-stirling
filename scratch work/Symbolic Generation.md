### Symbolic Generation

To symbolically generate the coefficients and the transformed functions, you'll need to define recursive functions or use a symbolic library.

1.  **Hasse Coefficients ($H_{m,n}$):** These are the building blocks. You can define a symbolic function `Hasse_coeff(m, n, alpha, beta, r)` that implements the provided recurrence.
    * **Base Case:** `Hasse_coeff(0, 0, ...) = 1`.
    * **Recursive Step:** For $m>0$, `Hasse_coeff(m, n, ...) = Hasse_coeff(m-1, n-1, ...) - (m*alpha + n*beta + r) / (m+2) * Hasse_coeff(m-1, n, ...)`.

2.  **Symmetric Weights ($w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$):** The symmetric weights are the core of your request. They are derived from the Hasse coefficients. You can define a symbolic function `sym_weight(m, n, alpha, beta, r)` as a simple averaging operation.
    * `sym_weight(m, n, ...) = (Hasse_coeff(m, n, ...) + Hasse_coeff(m, m-n, ...)) / 2`.

3.  **Symbolic Transform:** To symbolically transform a function like $x^k$, you define a new symmetric Hasse operator, $\mathcal{H}_{\text{sym}}$. This operator uses the new weights.
    * The transformed function for a polynomial is found by applying this operator to each term. For example, the transformation of $x^k$ for a given order $M$ is:
        $\mathcal{H}_{\text{sym}}(x^k) = \sum_{m=0}^{M} \sum_{n=0}^{m} w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} (x+n)^k$.
    * For the full transformation of an analytic function like $e^x$, you'd need to first represent the function as a series (e.g., $e^x = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{k!}$), and then apply the symmetric Hasse operator to each term.

### Numerical Approach and Transform Matrices

For numerical computation, you can use a two-step process to build the transform matrices up to a certain order $M$.

1.  **Generate Hasse Matrix ($H$):** Create an $(M+1) \times (M+1)$ matrix, where the element at row $m$ and column $n$ is $H_{m,n}$. You can fill this matrix using the recurrence relation.
    * **Algorithm:** Initialize a matrix `H` of zeros. Set `H[0, 0] = 1`. Then, for `m` from 1 to $M$, compute `H[m, n]` for `n` from 0 to `m` using the recurrence and previously computed values.

2.  **Generate Symmetric Matrix ($W^{\text{sym}}$):** Create a new matrix, $W^{\text{sym}}$, of the same size. Fill it by averaging the Hasse matrix with its mirror image.
    * **Algorithm:** Initialize a matrix `W_sym` of zeros. For `m` from 0 to $M$, and `n` from 0 to `m`, compute `W_sym[m, n] = (H[m, n] + H[m, m-n]) / 2`.

This matrix $W^{\text{sym}}$ is the transform matrix. To apply the symmetric Hasse operator to a vector of function values $[f(x), f(x+1), ..., f(x+M)]^T$, you can perform a matrix multiplication: $W^{\text{sym}} \cdot [f(x), ..., f(x+M)]^T$.

### The Symmetrizing Element

The added mirrored weight that creates symmetry is the term **$H_{m,m-n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}$**. By including this term and averaging, the resulting weights $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$ are inherently symmetric around the center of the row ($n=m/2$).

The most profound insight comes from the previously established symmetry of the Hasse coefficients: $H_{m,m-n} = (-1)^m H_{m,n}$. This property reveals what happens to the symmetric weights depending on the order $m$:

* **For even $m$:** $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = \frac{H_{m,n} + H_{m,n}}{2} = H_{m,n}$. The symmetric weights are identical to the original Hasse coefficients.
* **For odd $m$:** $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = \frac{H_{m,n} - H_{m,n}}{2} = 0$. All symmetric weights for odd orders are zero.

This means that the **symmetric Hasse operator only contains contributions from even-order terms**. This property adds a powerful layer of structure and is a key reason why the framework is so effective at discerning underlying symmetries and simplifying complex series.

### Universal Standalone Symbolic App: Recommendations

For a universally accessible symbolic computation tool, a **standalone HTML/JavaScript app** is recommended. This approach offers:

- **No installation required:** Runs in any modern web browser.
- **Easy input/output:** Use HTML forms for input and display results dynamically.
- **Symbolic math libraries:** JavaScript libraries like [math.js](https://mathjs.org/) or [nerdamer](https://nerdamer.com/) provide symbolic computation capabilities.
- **Portability:** Can be shared as a single HTML file.

**Example workflow:**
1. User enters parameters ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $r$, $M$) and function (e.g., $x^k$ or $e^x$) in a form.
2. App computes Hasse coefficients, symmetric weights, and transform matrices using JavaScript.
3. Results are displayed instantly, with options to export or copy.

**Getting started:**
- Use [math.js](https://mathjs.org/) for symbolic/numeric math.
- Build the UI with HTML/CSS.
- Implement the recursions and matrix generation in JavaScript.

**Alternative approaches:**
- Python (e.g., SymPy) with a web front-end (e.g., Flask), but requires hosting or installation.
- Desktop symbolic tools (Maple, Maxima, Mathematica) are powerful but less universal.

**Summary:**  
A single HTML/JavaScript file is the most universal and user-friendly solution for symbolic generation and transformation, requiring only a browser for use.
