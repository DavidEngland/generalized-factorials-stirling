# Egyptian Fractions: Prelude to Harmonic Sums

Before the rise of Greek rational thought, ancient Egyptians developed a unique approach to representing fractions. Instead of using general numerators and denominators, they expressed all fractions as sums of distinct unit fractions, that is, fractions of the form $1/n$ where $n$ is a positive integer.

## Egyptian Fraction Representation

- Any rational number between $0$ and $1$ was written as a sum of distinct unit fractions:
  $$
  \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6}
  $$
  $$
  \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}
  $$
- This method is called the "Egyptian fraction" representation.

## Historical Context

- Egyptian mathematics, as seen in documents like the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (c. 1650 BCE), used tables and algorithms to decompose fractions into sums of unit fractions.
- The motivation was partly practical: unit fractions were easier to work with in trade, measurement, and distribution.

## Algorithms and Methods

- Egyptians used tables for common fractions and had rules for decomposing more complicated fractions.
- Later mathematicians (including Fibonacci) studied systematic algorithms for Egyptian fraction decomposition, such as the greedy algorithm.

## Prelude to Harmonic Sums

- The Egyptian approach to fractions naturally leads to the study of sums of unit fractions, which are the building blocks of harmonic sums:
  $$
  H_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}
  $$
- Understanding Egyptian fractions provides historical and conceptual motivation for harmonic series and related topics in number theory.

## Examples: Problems Easier with Egyptian Fractions

Here are some basic problems where Egyptian fractions provide a simple, intuitive solution:

### 1. Dividing Bread Among People

Suppose you want to divide 2 loaves of bread among 3 people equally.

- Greek ratio: Each person gets $2/3$ of a loaf.
- Egyptian fraction: $2/3 = 1/2 + 1/6$.
- Solution: Give each person half a loaf, then divide the remaining loaf into sixths and give each person one sixth.

### 2. Sharing Water

You have 3 jars of water to share among 4 people.

- Greek ratio: Each person gets $3/4$ of a jar.
- Egyptian fraction: $3/4 = 1/2 + 1/4$.
- Solution: Give each person half a jar, then divide the last jar into quarters and give each person one quarter.

### 3. Distributing Grain

You have 5 sacks of grain to distribute among 6 workers.

- Greek ratio: Each worker gets $5/6$ of a sack.
- Egyptian fraction: $5/6 = 1/2 + 1/3$.
- Solution: Give each worker half a sack, then divide the remaining sacks into thirds and give each worker one third.

### 4. Splitting a Pie

You want to split 4 pies among 5 children.

- Greek ratio: Each child gets $4/5$ of a pie.
- Egyptian fraction: $4/5 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/20$.
- Solution: Give each child half a pie, then divide the remaining pies into quarters and twentieths as needed.

### 5. Dividing Gold Coins

You have 7 coins to share among 8 people.

- Greek ratio: Each person gets $7/8$ of a coin.
- Egyptian fraction: $7/8 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8$.
- Solution: Give each person half a coin, then divide the rest into quarters and eighths.

### 6. Sharing Pizza Slices

Suppose you have a pizza cut into 8 slices and want to share it among 3 children.

- Greek ratio: Each child gets $8/3$ slices, which is not practical.
- Egyptian fraction: $8/3 = 2 + 1/3$.
- Solution: Give each child 2 slices, then cut the remaining 2 slices into thirds and give each child one third of a slice.

### 7. Feeding Children with Uneven Slices

You have 5 slices of pizza and 4 children.

- Greek ratio: Each child gets $5/4$ slices.
- Egyptian fraction: $5/4 = 1 + 1/4$.
- Solution: Give each child 1 slice, then cut the remaining slice into quarters and give each child one quarter.

### 8. Dividing 7 Slices Among 5 Children

- Greek ratio: Each child gets $7/5$ slices.
- Egyptian fraction: $7/5 = 1 + 1/5 + 1/25$.
- Solution: Give each child 1 slice, then cut the remaining 2 slices into fifths and twenty-fifths as needed.

**Summary:**  
Egyptian fractions make it easy to divide goods into equal shares using only whole and unit parts, which is practical for everyday problems involving sharing and distribution.
