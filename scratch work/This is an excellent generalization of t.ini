This is an excellent generalization of the symmetric Hasse-Stirling framework. You're exploring different ways to impose or exploit symmetry in the Hasse coefficients, and each of the five symmetrization strategies you listed has potentially deep combinatorial and spectral implications. Here's a quick analysis and suggestions for each:
1. Weighted Symmetrization
w

(

m,n
p
​	
 +(1−λ)H 
m,m−n
p
​	
 
This creates a 1-parameter family of "biased symmetrizations". It interpolates between forward (
λ
=
1
λ=1) and backward (
λ
=
0
λ=0) indexing.
For spectral analysis, this biases the matrix 
W
(
m
)
(
λ
)
W 
(m)
 (λ) toward upper or lower triangular dominance depending on 
λ
λ.
Eigenstructure: as 
λ
→
0
λ→0 or 
1
1, the matrix may become increasingly asymmetric.
This is a clean testbed for studying how small asymmetry perturbs eigenvalues and eigenvectors (e.g. using perturbation theory).
You could study analytically (or numerically) how the odd-reciprocal eigenvector from the symmetric case 
(
λ
=
1
/
2
)
(λ=1/2) deforms under changes in 
λ
λ.
2. Symmetrization via Reflection Operator

 )
This operator-theoretic viewpoint is clean. It splits the space of sequences into:
A symmetric part (invariant under 
R
R)
An anti-symmetric part (eigenvalue 
−
1
−1 under 
R
R)
This decomposition lets you:
Study symmetric and antisymmetric eigenmodes separately.
Possibly project 
H
H into symmetry subspaces and study their evolution under different parameterizations.
Anti-symmetric weights may vanish on the diagonal (since 
n
=
m
−
n
n=m−n implies 
H
m
,
n
=
H
m
,
n
H 
m,n
​	
 =H 
m,n
​	
 , so subtraction kills the term), so these might isolate "deviation" from central symmetry.
3. Symmetrization Using Convolution

∑

k
)
 
H

m,n
conv
​	
 = 
k=0
∑

​	
 K(n,k)H 
m,k
​	
 ,K(n,k)=K(m−n,k)
This is a smoothing or kernel-based transformation — you're convolving with a symmetric kernel.
Ideas:
Gaussian-type kernels (discrete analogues) could suppress high-frequency variation and enforce smooth symmetry.
Could be seen as an approximation to a diffusion operator over Hasse layers.
The symmetry condition 
K
(
n
,
k
)
=
K
(
m
−
n
,
k
)
K(n,k)=K(m−n,k) ensures the overall convolution preserves reflection symmetry (in index 
n
n).
This opens doors to explore:
Toeplitz or circulant approximations.
Interpreting symmetric kernels as averaging over local neighborhoods of Hasse layers.
4. Symmetrization via Group Averaging
w
m
,
n
group
=
1
∣
G
∣
∑
g
∈
G
H
m
,
g
(
n
)
w 
m,n
group
​	
 = 
∣G∣
1
​	
  
g∈G
∑
​	
 H 
m,g(n)
​	
 
If there's a natural group 
G
G (say, the dihedral group acting on the index 
n
n), this gives a canonical symmetrization.
For example, 
G
=
Z
2
G=Z 
2
​	
  with 
g
(
n
)
=
m
−
n
g(n)=m−n gives back the usual reflection.
G
=
D
m
G=D 
m
​	
  (dihedral) could include more symmetries like rotations and flips (if the indices are placed in a circle).
For multinomial generalizations or tensor Hasse operators, higher group actions may become natural.
Averaging over group actions is a standard way to extract invariants — so this would produce invariant versions of the Hasse weights under 
G
G.
5. Symmetrization by Polynomial Projection
w
m
,
n
poly
=
Proj
sym
(
H
m
,
n
)
w 
m,n
poly
​	
 =Proj 
sym
​	
 (H 
m,n
​	
 )
This assumes you're working in a space where 
n
n and 
m
−
n
m−n appear symmetrically (e.g. 
x
=
n
x=n, 
y
=
m
−
n
y=m−n), and then projecting 
H
m
,
n
H 
m,n
​	
  onto symmetric polynomials in 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y).
If 
H
m
,
n
H 
m,n
​	
  is a polynomial in 
n
n, this projection is algebraically clean.
You could do this by expanding 
H
m
,
n
H 
m,n
​	
  in monomials and then symmetrizing each term using:
x
i
y
j
+
x
j
y
i
x 
i
 y 
j
 +x 
j
 y 
i
 
This idea generalizes if Hasse coefficients have closed-form expressions as polynomials in 
n
n.
This might connect nicely with:
Representation theory (symmetrization corresponds to taking invariant subspaces).
Classical theory of symmetric functions (e.g. Schur, elementary, complete homogeneous).
