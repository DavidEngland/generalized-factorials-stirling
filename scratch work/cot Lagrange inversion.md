This is a beautifully structured and pedagogically rich exposition, David ‚Äî you‚Äôve laid out the inverse trigonometric expansions and their Œ∂-connections with clarity and precision. Let‚Äôs build on your outline by diving deeper into the Lagrange inversion mechanics and giving a canonical expression for the inverse coefficients of cotangent in terms of Bernoulli numbers and Œ∂(2n). Then we can sketch how odd Œ∂-values sneak in through Mellin transforms and polylogarithmic continuations.

## üîÅ Inverse of Cotangent via Lagrange Inversion

Let‚Äôs start from the Laurent expansion of cotangent:

\[
\cot z = \frac{1}{z} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{2^{2n} B_{2n}}{(2n)!} z^{2n-1}
= \frac{1}{z} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n z^{2n-1}
\]

with \( a_n = (-1)^n \frac{2^{2n} B_{2n}}{(2n)!} \). These encode Œ∂(2n) via the identity:

\[
\zeta(2n) = (-1)^{n+1} \frac{(2\pi)^{2n} B_{2n}}{2(2n)!}
\]

Now, let \( w = \cot z \), and we seek the inverse series \( z = \arccot w \) as \( w \to \infty \). The Lagrange inversion formula gives:

\[
z = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(2n+1)!} \left. \frac{d^{2n}}{dz^{2n}} \left[ (z \cot z)^{2n+1} \right] \right|_{z=0} \cdot \frac{1}{w^{2n+1}}
\]

This yields the expansion:

\[
\arccot w = \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n w^{-2n-1}
\]

where each \( b_n \) is a universal polynomial in \( a_1, \dots, a_n \), and hence in Bernoulli numbers and Œ∂(2n). For example:

- \( b_0 = 1 \)
- \( b_1 = -a_1 = -\frac{1}{3} \)
- \( b_2 = -a_2 + a_1^2 = -\frac{1}{45} \)
- \( b_3 = -a_3 + 3a_1 a_2 - a_1^3 = -\frac{2}{945} \)

These match the coefficients in your boxed expansion. The pattern is governed by Fa√† di Bruno‚Äìtype combinatorics applied to the reversion of the Laurent series.

## üìä Summary: Œ∂(2n) in Arccot Coefficients

| Term | Coefficient \( b_n \) | Expression in Bernoulli / Œ∂(2n) |
|------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| \( b_0 \) | \( 1 \) | ‚Äî |
| \( b_1 \) | \( -\frac{1}{3} \) | \( -a_1 \) |
| \( b_2 \) | \( -\frac{1}{45} \) | \( -a_2 + a_1^2 \) |
| \( b_3 \) | \( -\frac{2}{945} \) | \( -a_3 + 3a_1 a_2 - a_1^3 \) |
| ‚ãÆ | ‚ãÆ | ‚ãÆ |

Each \( b_n \) is a polynomial in \( a_1, \dots, a_n \), and hence in Œ∂(2), Œ∂(4), ‚Ä¶, Œ∂(2n).

## üåå Where Odd Œ∂(2n+1) Appear

As you noted, odd zeta values are more elusive. Here are a few canonical appearances:

### 1. Mellin Transforms of Arctangent Kernels

For example:

\[
\int_0^1 x^{s-1} \arctan x \, dx = \frac{\pi}{2s} - \frac{1}{s} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \cdot \frac{1}{s + 2n}
\]

This integral has poles at negative odd integers and residues involving \( \zeta(2n+1) \) via analytic continuation.

### 2. Polylogarithmic and Clausen Function Identities

The identity:

\[
\arctan x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}
\]

leads, upon integration, to:

\[
\int_0^1 \frac{\arctan x}{x} \, dx = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)^2} = \frac{\pi}{2} \log 2
\]

and more generally, integrals of the form:

\[
\int_0^1 \frac{x^{k} \log x}{1+x^2} \, dx
\]

produce combinations of Œ∂(2n+1) and Dirichlet Œ≤-values.

### 3. Inverse Compositions and Nested Inversions

If you consider compositions like:

\[
\int_0^\infty \frac{\arccot x}{e^{2\pi x} - 1} \, dx
\]

or

\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\arccot(n)}{n^s}
\]

you‚Äôll find Œ∂(2n+1) appearing through integral transforms or Dirichlet series involving inverse trigonometric functions.

## üåâ Arccot‚ÄìPolylog Bridge: Integrals Leading to Polylogarithms at Roots of Unity

Integrals involving $\arccot$ (and related inverse trigonometric functions) often lead to polylogarithms evaluated at roots of unity, Clausen functions, and log-sine integrals. These connections are central to the appearance of odd zeta values and special constants.

### 1. Clausen Functions and Polylogarithms

The Clausen function $\operatorname{Cl}_2(\theta)$ is defined by:
$$
\operatorname{Cl}_2(\theta) = -\int_0^\theta \log|2\sin(t/2)|\,dt = \operatorname{Im} \operatorname{Li}_2(e^{i\theta})
$$
where $\operatorname{Li}_2(z)$ is the dilogarithm.

### 2. Example: Integral of $\arccot$ and Polylogarithms

Consider the integral:
$$
I = \int_0^1 \frac{\arccot x}{x} dx
$$
Using the series expansion for $\arccot x$:
$$
\arccot x = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arctan x = \frac{\pi}{2} - \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}
$$
So,
$$
I = \frac{\pi}{2} \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{x} - \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \int_0^1 x^{2n} dx
$$
The first term diverges, but the series yields:
$$
I = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)^2}
$$
This sum is related to the Dirichlet beta function and can be expressed in terms of $\operatorname{Cl}_2(\pi/2)$ and $\operatorname{Li}_2(i)$.

### 3. Log-Sine Integrals

Integrals of the form:
$$
\int_0^\pi \log(\sin t)\,dt
$$
and
$$
\int_0^\pi t \log(\sin t)\,dt
$$
are connected to polylogarithms at roots of unity and Clausen functions. For example:
$$
\int_0^{\pi/2} \log(\sin t)\,dt = -\frac{\pi}{2} \log 2
$$

### 4. Polylogarithms at Roots of Unity

Polylogarithms evaluated at $e^{i\theta}$ (roots of unity) appear in many identities involving inverse trigonometric integrals:
$$
\operatorname{Li}_s(e^{i\theta}) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{e^{i n \theta}}{n^s}
$$
The imaginary part gives Clausen functions, and the real part gives log-sine integrals.

### 5. Odd Zeta Values via Mellin Transforms

Integrals involving $\arccot$ and related functions, when transformed via Mellin or Fourier techniques, yield series and constants involving $\zeta(2n+1)$ and polylogarithms at roots of unity.

---

**Summary:**  
- Integrals of $\arccot$ and related inverse trigonometric functions naturally lead to polylogarithms at roots of unity, Clausen functions, and log-sine integrals.
- These connections explain the appearance of odd zeta values and special constants in analytic number theory and mathematical physics.
