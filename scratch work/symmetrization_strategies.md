# Symmetrization Strategies for Hasse Coefficients

This summary reviews five approaches to symmetrizing Hasse coefficients, with brief analysis and suggestions for further exploration.

## 1. Weighted Symmetrization

A one-parameter family interpolating between forward and backward indexing:
\[
w_{m,n}^{(\lambda)} = \lambda H_{m,n}^{\mathbf{p}} + (1-\lambda) H_{m,m-n}^{\mathbf{p}}
\]
- $\lambda=1/2$ gives the standard symmetric weights.
- Varying $\lambda$ biases the matrix toward upper or lower triangular dominance.
- Useful for studying how asymmetry perturbs eigenvalues/eigenvectors.

## 2. Symmetrization via Reflection Operator

Define a reflection operator $R(H_{m,n}) = H_{m,m-n}$, then split into symmetric and antisymmetric parts:
\[
w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = \frac{1}{2}(H_{m,n} + H_{m,m-n}), \quad
w_{m,n}^{\text{asym}} = \frac{1}{2}(H_{m,n} - H_{m,m-n})
\]
- Decomposes the space into symmetric (invariant under $R$) and antisymmetric (eigenvalue $-1$ under $R$) components.
- Allows separate study of symmetric and antisymmetric eigenmodes.

## 3. Symmetrization Using Convolution

Convolve Hasse coefficients with a symmetric kernel:
\[
w_{m,n}^{\text{conv}} = \sum_{k=0}^m K(n,k)\, H_{m,k}, \quad K(n,k) = K(m-n,k)
\]
- Smoothing transformation; kernel can be chosen (e.g., binomial, Gaussian).
- Preserves reflection symmetry in $n$.
- Can be interpreted as regularization or averaging over local neighborhoods.

## 4. Symmetrization via Group Averaging

Average over a group $G$ acting on the indices:
\[
w_{m,n}^{\text{group}} = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} H_{m, g(n)}
\]
- For $G = \mathbb{Z}_2$ with $g(n) = m-n$, recovers standard reflection.
- For larger groups (e.g., dihedral $D_m$), incorporates more symmetries.
- Produces invariant weights under group action.

---

## 5. Symmetrization by Polynomial Projection

Project $H_{m,n}$ onto symmetric polynomials in $n$ and $m-n$:
\[
w_{m,n}^{\text{poly}} = \text{Proj}_{\text{sym}}(H_{m,n})
\]
- Expand $H_{m,n}$ in monomials, symmetrize each term: $x^i y^j + x^j y^i$ for $x=n$, $y=m-n$.
- Connects to representation theory and classical symmetric functions.

## Odd-Reciprocal Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues: Why $\beta=0$ Is Special

The appearance of the odd-reciprocal eigenvector $[1, 1/3, 1/5, \ldots, 1/(2m+1)]$ and simple rational eigenvalues (like $1, 1/4, 1/6, \ldots$) for the symmetric Hasse matrix when $\beta=0$ is not just a trivial artifact—it reflects a deep cancellation in the algebraic structure:

- **At $\beta=0$:**  
  The recurrence and matrix entries simplify dramatically. The symmetric Hasse matrix becomes nearly diagonalizable with respect to the odd-reciprocal vector, and all off-diagonal complexity vanishes. This is a rare case where the combinatorial and analytic structure aligns perfectly, producing simple eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

- **For $\beta \neq 0$:**  
  The matrix loses this cancellation. The off-diagonal entries grow rapidly, and the principal eigenvalue becomes very large as $m$ increases. This is often a sign that the matrix is approaching a singularity or pole in its analytic continuation—large eigenvalues typically indicate proximity to a pole or instability in the underlying operator.

- **Why is this not trivial?**  
  The odd-reciprocal pattern is a "fixed point" of the recurrence at $\beta=0$. For other $\beta$, the recurrence introduces terms that break the symmetry and cause the spectrum to spread, leading to large eigenvalues and loss of simple structure.

- **Physical/analytic interpretation:**  
  At $\beta=0$, there are no "barriers" in the recurrence, so the system is maximally symmetric and stable. For $\beta \neq 0$, barriers are present, and the system can accumulate "mass" or "energy" in certain directions, reflected by large eigenvalues.

- **Connection to poles:**  
  The rapid growth of eigenvalues for large $m$ and $\beta \neq 0$ suggests the matrix is close to a pole in its analytic structure. This is typical in special function theory, where parameter choices near singularities cause instability or divergence.

**Summary:**  
The odd-reciprocal eigenvector phenomenon at $\beta=0$ is a delicate and nontrivial feature of the symmetric Hasse-Stirling framework. For other $\beta$, the loss of this structure and the emergence of large eigenvalues signal deeper analytic behavior—often related to poles or singularities in the underlying operator.

## Special Case: All Parameters Zero

When $\alpha = \beta = r = 0$, the Hasse coefficients are:
\[
H_{m,n} = \frac{(-1)^n \binom{m}{n}}{m+1}
\]

### Reflective Mirror

The "mirror" or reflected coefficient is:
\[
H_{m,m-n} = \frac{(-1)^{m-n} \binom{m}{m-n}}{m+1} = \frac{(-1)^{m-n} \binom{m}{n}}{m+1}
\]

### Symmetric Weights

The symmetric weight is the average of $H_{m,n}$ and its mirror:
\[
w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = \frac{H_{m,n} + H_{m,m-n}}{2}
= \frac{1}{2(m+1)} \left[ (-1)^n + (-1)^{m-n} \right] \binom{m}{n}
\]

#### Simplified Form

- If $m$ is even:
  - $(-1)^n + (-1)^{m-n} = 2(-1)^n$ when $n$ and $m-n$ have the same parity
  - $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = \frac{(-1)^n \binom{m}{n}}{m+1}$ (i.e., $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = H_{m,n}$)
- If $m$ is odd:
  - $(-1)^n + (-1)^{m-n} = 0$ for all $n$
  - $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = 0$

**Summary:**  
- For even $m$, the symmetric weights equal the original Hasse coefficients.
- For odd $m$, the symmetric weights vanish identically.

## Parity, Odd Harmonics, and Connection to Odd Zeta Values

The structure of the Hasse coefficients and their symmetric weights with all parameters zero ($\alpha = \beta = r = 0$) is deeply tied to parity:

- For **even $m$**, the symmetric weights are nonzero and match the original Hasse coefficients.
- For **odd $m$**, the symmetric weights vanish identically.

This mirrors the behavior of **odd harmonics** in Fourier analysis, where only certain modes survive under symmetry constraints.

### Connection to Zeta Values at Odd Integers

Recall that the closed-form derivation for $\zeta(2n+1)$ (odd integer values) using the Hasse-Stirling framework involves sums over Hasse coefficients and powers of logarithms. The parity structure in the coefficients is crucial:

- Only terms with **even $m$** contribute nontrivially to the symmetric operator.
- The alternating binomial structure and normalization ($1/(m+1)$) encode the cancellation and symmetry needed for the analytic continuation and special value formulas.

**Key Insight:**  
The ability to separate even and odd $m$ in the Hasse framework is not just a technicality—it is essential for isolating the contributions to special values like $\zeta(2n+1)$. The symmetry and vanishing of odd $m$ rows reflect the underlying functional equation and parity properties of the zeta function.
