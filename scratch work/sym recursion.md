# Symmetric Recursion for Hasse Coefficients

Given the standard Hasse coefficient recursion:
\[
H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} = H_{m-1,n-1}^{\alpha,\beta,r} - \frac{m\alpha + n\beta + r}{m+2} H_{m-1,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}
\]

The symmetric weights are defined as:
\[
w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = \frac{H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} + H_{m,m-n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}}{2}
\]

## Compact Recursion and Initial Condition

The compact recursion for symmetric weights is:
\[
w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = w_{m-1,n-1}^{\text{sym}} - \frac{1}{2(m+2)} \left[ (m\alpha + n\beta + r) H_{m-1,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} + (m\alpha + (m-n)\beta + r) H_{m-1,m-n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} \right]
\]

with the initial condition:
\[
w_{0,0}^{\text{sym}} = 1
\]

This initial condition is trivial, since for $m=0$ and $n=0$,
\[
w_{0,0}^{\text{sym}} = \frac{H_{0,0}^{\alpha,\beta,r} + H_{0,0}^{\alpha,\beta,r}}{2} = H_{0,0}^{\alpha,\beta,r} = 1
\]

**Remark:**  
By the symmetry property $H_{m,m-n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} = (-1)^m H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}$, the symmetric weights $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$ behave as follows:
- For even $m$, $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}$.
- For odd $m$, $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = 0$.

This means the symmetric matrix has all entries zero for odd rows except possibly the diagonal.

**Homework Problem:**  
Show that for the symmetric weights defined above, $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = 0$ for all $n$ when $m$ is odd, and $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}$ when $m$ is even.  
*Hint: Use the symmetry property $H_{m,m-n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} = (-1)^m H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}$ in the definition of $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$.*

**Notes:**
- $H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}$ are the generalized Hasse coefficients.
- $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$ averages the coefficients for $n$ and $m-n$.
- The recursion for $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$ uses both the symmetric property and the original Hasse recursion.
- The symmetric weights are initialized trivially: $w_{0,0}^{\text{sym}} = 1$.

**Eigenvalue/Eigenvector Problem:**  
Since the symmetric matrix $W^{\text{sym}}$ is real and (for even $m$) symmetric, it is natural to consider its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. These can reveal important structural properties and may correspond to special polynomial bases or transformation behaviors.

- **Problem:**  
  For a given order $M$, compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the symmetric matrix $W^{\text{sym}}$ constructed from the weights $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$.  
  - Are the eigenvalues always real?
  - What do the eigenvectors represent in terms of the original polynomial or function basis?
  - How do the eigenvalues/eigenvectors change as $\alpha$, $\beta$, $r$ vary?

*Hint: Use standard linear algebra techniques (e.g., diagonalization, spectral theorem) and consider the structure for even and odd $m$.*

## Answer Sheet: Eigenvalue/Eigenvector Problem

**Step-by-step guide and hints:**

1. **Construct the Matrix $W^{\text{sym}}$**
   - For a fixed order $M$, build the $(M+1) \times (M+1)$ matrix whose $(m, n)$ entry is $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$.
   - Recall: For odd $m$, all entries are zero; for even $m$, $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}$.

2. **Check Symmetry and Reality**
   - $W^{\text{sym}}$ is real-valued by construction.
   - For even $m$, the matrix is symmetric: $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = w_{m,m-n}^{\text{sym}}$.
   - By the spectral theorem, symmetric real matrices have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

3. **Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**
   - Use any standard linear algebra package (e.g., numpy in Python, math.js in JavaScript, or a symbolic tool).
   - For small $M$, you can compute them by hand or with a calculator.
   - For larger $M$, use the matrix diagonalization or eigendecomposition routines.

4. **Interpretation**
   - The eigenvectors form a basis in which the symmetric Hasse transformation acts diagonally.
   - The eigenvalues indicate the scaling effect of the transformation along each eigenvector direction.
   - For different choices of $\alpha$, $\beta$, $r$, the matrix entries change, affecting the spectrum.

5. **Special Cases**
   - For $M$ odd, the corresponding rows are zero, so the matrix is block-diagonal with zero blocks.
   - For $M$ even, the matrix is full and symmetric.

**Hints:**
- Try computing $W^{\text{sym}}$ for $M=2$ or $M=4$ with simple parameters (e.g., $\alpha=0$, $\beta=1$, $r=0$).
- Use the symmetry property to simplify calculations.
- For a diagonal matrix, eigenvalues are the diagonal entries; for symmetric matrices, use characteristic polynomial or numerical routines.

**Example Calculation (for $M=2$, $\alpha=0$, $\beta=1$, $r=0$):**
1. Compute $H_{m,n}$ for $m=0,1,2$ and $n=0,\ldots,m$.
2. Build $W^{\text{sym}}$ using the definition.
3. Write out the matrix explicitly.
4. Find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
