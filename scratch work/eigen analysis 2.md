### **Eigen Analysis of Generalized Hasse-Stirling Matrices**

This document explores the structure and spectral properties of matrices derived from the generalized Hasse-Stirling framework. We use a vector notation for the parameters to provide a cleaner and more generalized view.

### **1. Generalized Stirling Numbers**

**Role:** These numbers, denoted $S(n, k; \mathbf{p})$, serve as the fundamental combinatorial building blocks. They encode the combinatorics governed by the parameter vector $\mathbf{p} = (\alpha, \beta, r)$.

**Recurrence:**
$$S(n, k; \mathbf{p}) = S(n-1, k-1; \mathbf{p}) + (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{v}_{k,-n}) S(n-1, k; \mathbf{p})$$
where the index vector is defined as $\mathbf{v}_{n,k} = (n, k, 1)$.

**Boundary Conditions:**
$$S(0,0;\mathbf{p}) = 1, \quad S(n,k;\mathbf{p}) = 0 \text{ for } k > n \text{ or } k < 0$$

This recurrence elegantly generalizes classical Stirling numbers of both the first and second kind, depending on the parameterization.

### **2. Hasse Coefficients**

**Role:** The Hasse coefficients, $H_{m,n}^{\mathbf{p}}$, act as the "weights" for the Hasse operator, transforming the generalized Stirling numbers into a basis for polynomial expansions.

**Definition (via Stirling expansion):**
$$H_{m,n}^{\mathbf{p}} = \frac{1}{m+1} \sum_{j=0}^{n} (-1)^{n-j} \binom{n}{j} S(m, j; \mathbf{p})$$

**Direct Recurrence:**
$$H_{m,n}^{\mathbf{p}} = H_{m-1,n-1}^{\mathbf{p}} - \frac{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{v}_{m,n}}{m+2} H_{m-1,n}^{\mathbf{p}}$$

**Boundary Conditions:**
$$H_{0,0}^{\mathbf{p}} = 1, \quad H_{m,0}^{\mathbf{p}} = \frac{1}{m+1}, \quad H_{m,m}^{\mathbf{p}} = \frac{(-1)^m}{m+1}, \quad H_{m,n}^{\mathbf{p}} = 0 \text{ for } n > m \text{ or } n < 0$$

### **3. Symmetric Weights**

**Role:** The symmetric weights, $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$, are derived by averaging Hasse coefficients to produce a balanced, symmetric kernel.

**Definition:**
$$w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = \frac{H_{m,n}^{\mathbf{p}} + H_{m,m-n}^{\mathbf{p}}}{2}$$

**Recurrence:**
$$w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = w_{m-1,n-1}^{\text{sym}} - \frac{1}{2(m+2)} \left[ (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{v}_{m,n}) H_{m-1,n}^{\mathbf{p}} + (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{v}_{m,m-n}) H_{m-1,m-n}^{\mathbf{p}} \right]$$

**Key Observations:**
* **Built-in Duality:** The definition automatically enforces a reflection symmetry across the midpoint of each row.
* **Modified Recurrence:** The recurrence is more complex, requiring two different Hasse coefficients to maintain the symmetry. This is the "cost" of ensuring a balanced operator.

### **4. Tables for Small $m$ (with $r=0$)**

These tables show the computed values for small $m$ to provide a concrete view of the algebraic structure. We set $r=0$ and use $a=\alpha$ and $b=\beta$ for clarity.

#### **Generalized Stirling Numbers $S(m,k;a,b,0)$**

| $m \backslash k$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | | | |
| 1 | $-b$ | 1 | | |
| 2 | $2b^2$ | $a-3b$ | 1 | |
| 3 | $-6b^3$ | $a^2-6ab+11b^2$ | $3(a-2b)$ | 1 |

#### **Hasse Coefficients $H_{m,n}^{a,b,0}$**

| $m \backslash n$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | | | |
| 1 | $-\frac{b}{2}$ | $\frac{1-b}{2}$ | | |
| 2 | $\frac{2b^2}{3}$ | $\frac{a-3b-2b^2}{3}$ | $\frac{2b^2+a-b-a}{3}$ | |
| 3 | $-\frac{b^3}{4}$ | $\frac{b^2(a-3b)}{4} + \frac{b(1-b)}{4}$ | $\dots$ | $\dots$ |

#### **Symmetric Weights $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$**

| $m \backslash n$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | | | |
| 1 | $\frac{1-b}{2}$ | $\frac{1-b}{2}$ | | |
| 2 | $\frac{2b^2}{3}+\frac{a-3b}{3}$ | $\frac{a-3b-2b^2}{3}$ | $\frac{2b^2}{3}+\frac{a-3b}{3}$ | |
| 3 | $\dots$ | $\dots$ | $\dots$ | $\dots$ |

The tables above show that the entries are polynomials in $\alpha$ and $\beta$, revealing the dependency of the weights on the chosen parameters. The symmetric weights, by construction, are always symmetric across the column midpoint.

### **5. Eigen Analysis of Symmetric Hasse Matrices**

**Setup:** We construct a lower-triangular $(m+1) \times (m+1)$ matrix $W(m)$ for fixed $m$ with entries $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$.

#### **Case 1: $\beta = 0$**

For the specific case where $\alpha=0, \beta=0, r=0$, a remarkable pattern emerges in the eigenvalues and eigenvectors:
* The principal eigenvector is proportional to the sequence of odd reciprocals: $[1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{5}, \dots, \frac{1}{2m+1}]$.
* The corresponding eigenvalue is exactly $1$.
* All other eigenvectors are standard basis vectors, $[0, \dots, 1, \dots, 0]$, with eigenvalues equal to $\frac{1}{2k+2}$.

This indicates an exceptionally clean spectral decomposition, where the matrix has a dominant "direction" that is the odd-reciprocal vector, and the rest of the space is simple.

#### **Case 2: $\beta \neq 0$**

For any other choice of parameters, like $\beta = 1/2$ or $\beta=1$, this elegant structure is lost. The principal eigenvector is no longer the odd-reciprocal vector and the eigenvalues are no longer simple rationals. This suggests the **odd-reciprocal pattern is a delicate phenomenon that only exists at the specific parameter choice $\beta=0$**.

### **6. Analytic Proof for $\beta=0$ Case**

This elegant behavior for $\beta=0$ can be proven using generating functions. The key is to show that the action of the symmetric Hasse operator on the vector of odd reciprocals, $[1, 1/3, 1/5, \dots]$, leaves the vector unchanged (up to a scaling factor of 1). This confirms that it is an eigenvector with an eigenvalue of 1. The result stems from the cancellation of terms in the Hasse recurrence at this specific parameter point.

### **7. Summary**

The symmetric Hasse matrices provide a powerful lens for studying generalized orthogonal polynomials and their properties. The symmetric weights enforce a reflection symmetry that, for specific parameter choices, leads to a clean and elegant spectral decomposition. The discovery that the odd-reciprocal eigenvector only emerges at $\beta=0$ is a significant insight, showing that the framework can be tuned to isolate specific mathematical structures. The framework is ripe for further exploration, particularly in connecting the behavior of these matrices to the properties of their generated polynomials.
