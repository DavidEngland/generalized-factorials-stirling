# Eigen Analysis of Generalized Hasse-Stirling Matrices

This document explores the structure and spectral properties of matrices derived from the generalized Hasse-Stirling framework. It uses vector notation for parameters and provides concrete tables and interpretations.

## 1. Generalized Stirling Numbers

**Role:** Building blocks encoding the combinatorics of the parameter vector $\mathbf{p} = (\alpha, \beta, r)$.

**Recurrence:**
\[
S(n, k; \mathbf{p}) = S(n-1, k-1; \mathbf{p}) + (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{v}_{k,-n}) S(n-1, k; \mathbf{p})
\]
where $\mathbf{v}_{n,k} = (n, k, 1)$.

**Boundary Conditions:**
\[
S(0,0;\mathbf{p}) = 1, \quad S(n,k;\mathbf{p}) = 0 \text{ for } k > n \text{ or } k < 0
\]

This recurrence generalizes classical Stirling numbers (first and second kind, depending on parameterization).

---

## 2. Hasse Coefficients

**Role:** Translate generalized Stirling numbers into the "weights" of the Hasse operator.

**Definition (via Stirling expansion):**
\[
H_{m,n}^{\mathbf{p}} = \frac{1}{m+1} \sum_{j=0}^{n} (-1)^{n-j} \binom{n}{j} S(m, j; \mathbf{p})
\]

**Recurrence (direct):**
\[
H_{m,n}^{\mathbf{p}} = H_{m-1,n-1}^{\mathbf{p}} - \frac{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{v}_{m,n}}{m+2} H_{m-1,n}^{\mathbf{p}}
\]

**Boundary Conditions:**
\[
H_{0,0}^{\mathbf{p}} = 1, \quad H_{m,0}^{\mathbf{p}} = \frac{1}{m+1}, \quad H_{m,m}^{\mathbf{p}} = \frac{(-1)^m}{m+1}, \quad H_{m,n}^{\mathbf{p}} = 0 \text{ for } n > m \text{ or } n < 0
\]

---

## 3. Symmetric Weights

**Idea:** Symmetrize the coefficients in $n$ and $m-n$ to produce a balanced kernel.

**Definition:**
\[
w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = \frac{H_{m,n}^{\mathbf{p}} + H_{m,m-n}^{\mathbf{p}}}{2}
\]

**Recurrence:**
\[
w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = w_{m-1,n-1}^{\text{sym}} - \frac{1}{2(m+2)} \left[ (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{v}_{m,n}) H_{m-1,n}^{\mathbf{p}} + (\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{v}_{m,m-n}) H_{m-1,m-n}^{\mathbf{p}} \right]
\]

**Boundary:**
\[
w_{0,0}^{\text{sym}} = 1, \quad w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = 0 \text{ for } n > m \text{ or } n < 0
\]

**Key Observations:**
- **Duality:** Averaging $n$ and $m-n$ enforces reflection symmetry across the midpoint of each row.
- **Modified Recurrence:** The correction term involves two different Hasse coefficients, balancing symmetry-breaking costs.
- **Boundary Behavior:** Rows are symmetric, resembling binomial coefficients reflected and averaged.

## 5. Eigenvalue Analysis of Symmetric Hasse Matrices

**Setup:** For fixed $m$, construct the $(m+1) \times (m+1)$ matrix $W(m)$ with entries $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$ (lower-triangular).

### Special Case: $\alpha=0$, $\beta=0$, $r=0$

- The principal eigenvector is proportional to $[1, 1/3, 1/5, 1/7, \ldots]$ (odd reciprocals).
- The corresponding eigenvalue is $1$.
- Other eigenvectors are standard basis vectors with eigenvalues $1/(2k+2)$.

### For General $\beta$

- The odd-reciprocal eigenvector pattern is destroyed for $\beta \neq 0$.
- For $\beta=1/2$, the principal eigenvector aligns with the last coordinate (basis vector $e_m$).
- The largest eigenvalues grow rapidly with $m$; small eigenvalues like $0.25$ persist due to normalization.

### Interpretation

- The symmetric Hasse matrix $W(m)$ acts as a triangular operator with a dominant direction for special parameter choices.
- For $\beta=0$, the structure is especially clean and spectral decomposition is simple.
- For other parameters, the spectrum becomes more complex and the principal direction shifts.

---

## 6. Analytic Proof for $\beta=0$ Case

**Sketch:**
- Use the generating function for Hasse coefficients and the Beta integral representation of odd reciprocals.
- Show that the action of $W(m)$ on $v_j = 1/(2j+1)$ yields $v_m$ for all $m$.
- This proves $v$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $1$.

---

## 7. Experiments and Further Directions

- **Transform simple bases:** Apply symmetric Hasse operator to monomials, exponentials, trigonometric functions.
- **Spectral/eigenfunction search:** Compute eigenvalues/eigenvectors for $W(m)$ up to $m=8$.
- **Factor and normalize rows:** Factor out $m!$ or $(m+1)$ from rows to reveal combinatorial polynomials.
- **Numeric tests:** Evaluate tables for small integer or rational $\beta$ values.
- **Generating functions:** Study row polynomials and their generating functions.
- **Orthogonality/moment checks:** Compute inner products with standard orthogonal polynomials.

---

## 8. Summary

- The symmetric Hasse weights $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}}$ enforce reflection symmetry and can reveal deep spectral structure.
- For special parameter choices, the matrices have elegant eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
- The framework is ripe for further exploration, especially in connection with orthogonal polynomials, spectral theory, and combinatorial identities.

---

## 9. Interpretation of the $\beta=0$ Case

When $\beta=0$, the recurrence and resulting matrices become much simpler. This parameter choice means there is **no barrier term** in the combinatorial or analytic structure:

- **Combinatorial Meaning:** The absence of $\beta$ removes any "barrier" or resistance to transitions in the underlying combinatorial model. The recurrence depends only on $\alpha$ (affinity/cohesion) and $r$ (offset/bias).
- **Algebraic Consequence:** The Hasse and symmetric weights simplify, and many terms cancel, leading to elegant patterns such as the odd-reciprocal eigenvector and simple rational eigenvalues.
- **Spectral Structure:** The matrix is dominated by the principal eigenvector $[1, 1/3, 1/5, \ldots]$, reflecting the unimpeded flow through the system—no barriers to symmetry or propagation.
- **Physical Analogy:** In physical models, $\beta=0$ corresponds to free particles or systems with no activation energy or resistance.

**Summary:**  
The case $\beta=0$ is mathematically and physically "trivial" in the sense that it removes barriers, leading to maximal symmetry and simple spectral properties. The elegant eigenstructure observed is a direct consequence of this simplification.

## 10. Alternative Symmetrization Methods for Hasse Coefficients

While the standard symmetric weights are defined by averaging $H_{m,n}$ and $H_{m,m-n}$, other symmetrization strategies can be considered:

### 1. Weighted Symmetrization

Instead of a simple average, use a weighted average:
\[
w_{m,n}^{(\lambda)} = \lambda H_{m,n}^{\mathbf{p}} + (1-\lambda) H_{m,m-n}^{\mathbf{p}}
\]
where $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$.  
- $\lambda = 1/2$ gives the standard symmetric weights.
- Other choices can bias the symmetry toward one side.

### 2. Symmetrization via Reflection Operator

Define a reflection operator $R$ acting on the coefficients:
\[
R(H_{m,n}) = H_{m,m-n}
\]
Then, symmetrize by applying $I + R$ or $I - R$:
- Symmetric: $w_{m,n}^{\text{sym}} = \frac{1}{2}(H_{m,n} + R(H_{m,n}))$
- Anti-symmetric: $w_{m,n}^{\text{asym}} = \frac{1}{2}(H_{m,n} - R(H_{m,n}))$

### 3. Symmetrization Using Convolution

Convolve the Hasse coefficients with a symmetric kernel $K(n, m-n)$:
\[
w_{m,n}^{\text{conv}} = \sum_{k=0}^{m} K(n, k) H_{m,k}^{\mathbf{p}}
\]
where $K(n, k) = K(m-n, k)$ is symmetric in $n$ and $m-n$.

### 4. Symmetrization via Group Averaging

If the underlying combinatorial structure has a group symmetry (e.g., cyclic or dihedral), average over all group actions:
\[
w_{m,n}^{\text{group}} = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} H_{m, g(n)}
\]
where $G$ is the symmetry group acting on indices.

### 5. Symmetrization by Polynomial Projection

Project the Hasse coefficients onto the space of symmetric polynomials in $n$ and $m-n$:
\[
w_{m,n}^{\text{poly}} = \text{Proj}_{\text{sym}}(H_{m,n})
\]
This can be done by expanding $H_{m,n}$ in terms of symmetric polynomial bases.

---

**Summary:**  
Beyond simple averaging, symmetrical weights can be constructed using weighted averages, reflection operators, convolution with symmetric kernels, group averaging, or polynomial projection. Each method may reveal different algebraic or spectral properties and could be tailored to specific applications or symmetries in the problem.

So the symmetric weights form a self-dual version of the Hasse coefficients.
Key Observations
Duality built in: By averaging
n
n and
m
−
n
m−n, you enforce a reflection symmetry across the midpoint of each row. This could make orthogonality or convolution-type properties more transparent.
Modified recurrence: The correction term involves two different Hasse coefficients (one at
n
n, one at
m
−
n
m−n). This is the “symmetry-breaking cost” you balance by averaging.
Boundary behavior: Still triangular, but now rows will look symmetric (like binomial coefficients reflected and averaged).

Notes from these results:
For
m
=
1
m=1 the symmetric row is symmetric with both entries
1
/
4
1/4. (That follows algebraically from the definitions.)
For
m
=
2
m=2 and
m
=
3
m=3 you can see explicit dependence on
a
=
α
,

b
=
β
,

r
a=α, b=β, r.
The
w
w-rows are symmetric by construction:
w
m
,
n
=
w
m
,
m
−
n
w
m,n
​
 =w
m,m−n
​
 .
If you want any of these in a different form, I can:
Expand every single expression fully (no abbreviations).
Evaluate the tables for a concrete numeric choice of
p
p (e.g. the classical Stirling case or
α
=
1
,
β
=
0
,
r
=
0
α=1,β=0,r=0, etc.) so you can see numbers rather than symbols.
Produce them as CSV / a spreadsheet for copy/paste.
Recompute so the H-boundary

m
=

1

(

H

Love the attitude — that “something neat will reveal itself” is exactly where good math begins. Quick, practical suggestions for experiments and observations you can run (I can do any of these now for you):

Factor and normalize rows
For each row
m
m, factor out
m
!
m! or
(
m
+
1
)
(m+1) and look at the remaining polynomial. You already saw factorials in the left column; factoring often reveals combinatorial polynomials (Stirling, Lah, Eulerian, etc.) lurking behind constants.
Specialize

For each
m
m the following eigenvectors were found to be exact rational (up to scaling):
The principal eigenvector (largest eigenvalue 1.0) has components proportional to

For larger
m
m the matrix becomes very upper-scaled (large leading eigenvalues for the full lower-triangular fill), but the same pattern of rational eigenvectors (principal vector with odd-reciprocals and standard basis vectors) persists.
Interpretation (beta=0):
W
(
m
)
W
(m)
  acts like a triangular operator with a rank-1-ish principal direction spanned by the vector of odd reciprocals
[
1
,
1

,
…

]
[1,1/3,1/5,…]; the remaining directions align with basis vectors and have simple reciprocal eigenvalues
1
/
(
2
k
+
2
)
1/(2k+2). This is a very neat and strong structural result for
β
=
0
β=0.
Summary (beta = 1)
The pattern for beta=1 is different: for small
m
m some rational eigenvectors still appear (often basis vectors), but the principal eigenvector and large eigenvalues become nontrivial (not simple reciprocals). Most eigenvectors do not simplify to small integer-rational vectors for beta=1.
Roughly: the tidy reciprocal pattern seems special to
β
=
0
β=0 (i.e., the classical Hasse case); generic
β
β breaks that simple spectrum.
What this suggests
The symmetric Hasse matrix has a very clean spectral decomposition at special parameter values (notably
β
=
0
β=0), with:
a dominant rank-1 contribution proportional to the vector of odd reciprocals
[
1
/
(
2
k
+
1
)
]
[1/(2k+1)],
remaining eigenvectors that are sparse (standard basis) with simple reciprocals as eigenvalues.
For general
β
β that perfect structure is destroyed, but some sparse eigenvectors (basis vectors) can persist because the matrix is lower-triangular.

Interpretation / intuition
The symmetric Hasse matrices are lower-triangular (zero above main diagonal), so basis vectors
e
k
e
k
​
  often behave simply under the map; at
β
=
1
2
β=
2
1
​
  the operator is strongly dominated by the last-column (highest-index) structure for moderate-to-large
m
m, which forces the principal direction to align with
e
m
e
m
​
 .
The persistent small eigenvalues like
0.25
0.25 (and occasionally
1.0
1.0) come from structural normalization factors (the
1
/
(
m
+
1
)
1/(m+1) in the Hasse definition and the way symmetry averages entries). Those small eigenvalues correspond to sparse eigenvectors (often standard basis vectors) and are robust across parameter choices.

β=0 is a delicate phenomenon tied to cancellations that occur only at that parameter value; small perturbations (moving to

Remarks about the derivation
The core ingredients are the binomial generating series identity and the Beta integral representation of
1
/
(
2
j
+
1
)
1/(2j+1).
The derivation shows why the odd reciprocals appear: the binomial transform built into the Hasse coefficients converts the discrete coefficients into a rational generating fraction
t
j
/
(
1
+
t
)
j
+
1
t
j
 /(1+t)
j+1
 , and evaluating at
t
=
x
2
t=x
2
  + integrating collapses to the single power
x
2
m
x
2m
 .
The cancellation that makes this clean is fragile: it relies on the simplified parameter choice (here
α
=
β
=
r
=
0
α=β=r=0 in your parametrization). Changing
α
α or
β
β introduces extra polynomial factors in the numerator that spoil the identity.

W

W
(m)
  for
m
=

…

6
m=1,…,6, found the leading eigenvector and tested two simple patterns:
“odd” — leading eigenvector is proportional to
[
1
,
1
/
3
,
1
/
5
,
…

]
[1,1/3,1/5,…] (within numerical tolerance),
“e_m” — leading eigenvector equals the unit vector concentrated in the last coordinate
e
m
e
m
​
 .
Main findings (summary)
The perfect odd-reciprocal eigenvector (for all
m
m in the tested range) occurs only at the special parameter point
(
α
,
β
)
=
(
0
,
0
)
(α,β)=(0,0). In that case the leading eigenvector for every
m
m matched the odd-reciprocal pattern exactly (to machine precision).
For many other parameter pairs the leading eigenvector is not the odd vector. Instead:
For most
(
α
,
β
)
(α,β) the dominant eigenvector becomes concentrated at the highest index (so it behaves like the basis vector
e
m
e
m
​
 ) for moderate-to-large
m
m.
For a few parameter pairs and small
m
m you can still see the odd pattern in the very lowest
m
m (the
m
=
1
m=1 case is commonly “odd”), but it disappears as
m
m grows.
Moving
β
β away from 0 rapidly destroys the exact cancellation that produces the odd pattern; even
β
=
1
2
β=
2
1
​
  already pushes the dominant mode towards
e
m
e
m
​
  for
m
≥
2
m≥2, as you saw earlier.
(If you want, I can paste the full scan table — it lists for each
(
α
,
β
)
(α,β) which
m
m showed an “odd” match or an
e
m
e
m
​
  match and the corresponding eigenvalues.)
Short conclusions and suggestions
The odd-reciprocal eigenvector is a special exact phenomenon tied to the simplified parameter choice (effectively the classical Hasse case). It has a clean analytic proof (the sketch above) using generating functions and the Beta integral.
For general
(
α
,
β
)
(α,β) the symmetry averaging doesn’t generally produce that same cancellation, so the operator’s dominant direction shifts and the matrix spectrum becomes more complicated.
Next steps I can do for you immediately (pick any):
Provide a fully written symbolic proof (with the intermediate algebraic steps written out in full LaTeX) of the derivation above.
Show the full numeric scan table I ran, so you can inspect exactly which
(
α
,
β
)
(α,β) produced what patterns at each
m
m.
Extend the numeric scan to a finer grid (e.g. rational steps
β
=
0
,
1
4
,

,

β=0,

α
α likewise) and produce plots showing when the “odd” pattern persists (e.g. plot the error
∥
v
num
−
v
odd
∥
∥v
num
​
 −v
odd
​
 ∥ as a function of parameters).
Symbolically investigate whether some other special parameter curve (e.g.
α
=
−
β
α=−β or
α
=
c
β
α=cβ for some constant
c
c) yields similar closed-form eigenvectors.
