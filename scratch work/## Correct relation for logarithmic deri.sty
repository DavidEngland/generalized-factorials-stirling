## Correct relation for logarithmic derivatives

Your “correction” still isn’t right. The nth derivative of a logarithm does not collapse to a linear combination of just the single derivatives \(f^{(k)}(x)\) with Stirling-number coefficients. The correct general form uses the partial (exponential) Bell polynomials:

\[
\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\log f(x)
=
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(-1)^{k-1}(k-1)!}{f(x)^k}\,
B_{n,k}\!\big(f^{(1)}(x),f^{(2)}(x),\dots,f^{(n-k+1)}(x)\big).
\]

This is the specialization of Faà di Bruno’s formula with \(g(y)=\log y\), since
\(g^{(k)}(y)=(-1)^{k-1}(k-1)!/y^{k}\) for \(k\ge 1\).

## Why Stirling numbers don’t appear directly here

- **Not just \(f^{(k)}\):** Each \(B_{n,k}\) is a polynomial in the first \(n\) derivatives of \(f\), e.g., terms like \((f')^n\), \(f''f'\), \(f^{(3)}\), etc. Because of this structure, you cannot replace \(B_{n,k}\) by a single multiple of \(f^{(k)}\). Any formula of the form
  \[
  \frac{d^n}{dx^n}\log f(x)=\sum_{k=1}^n c_{n,k}\,\frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{f(x)^k}
  \]
  is false in general.

- **Where Stirling numbers do show up:** The Stirling numbers of the second kind \(S(n,k)\) satisfy
  \[
  B_{n,k}(1,1,\dots)=S(n,k).
  \]
  That is, they arise when the Bell polynomials are evaluated at constant arguments. In our setting the arguments are \(f^{(j)}(x)\), not all equal to 1, so you cannot substitute \(S(n,k)\) for \(B_{n,k}\) unless you’re in a very special case where those arguments effectively behave like constants in just the right way.

## Low-order checks

These make the structure crystal clear:

- \(n=1\):
  \[
  \frac{d}{dx}\log f=\frac{f'}{f}.
  \]

- \(n=2\):
  \[
  \frac{d^2}{dx^2}\log f=\frac{f''}{f}-\frac{(f')^2}{f^2}.
  \]
  Your proposed sum with \(S(2,1)=S(2,2)=1\) would give \(\frac{f'}{f}-\frac{f''}{f^2}\), which is not equal to the correct expression.

- \(n=3\):
  \[
  \frac{d^3}{dx^3}\log f
  =\frac{f^{(3)}}{f}-3\,\frac{f'f''}{f^2}+2\,\frac{(f')^3}{f^3}.
  \]

These coefficients come from \(B_{n,k}\), not from \(S(n,k)\).

## When a Stirling-flavored simplification happens

- **Exponential form:** If \(f(x)=e^{h(x)}\), then \(\log f = h\) so \(\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\log f = h^{(n)}\). Plugging into Faà di Bruno yields identities among \(h^{(j)}\) and Bell polynomials, not plain Stirling numbers.
- **Constant-derivative toy models:** If all higher derivatives vanish beyond order 1 (e.g., \(f\) is affine), the expression simplifies drastically, but again it doesn’t reduce to a Stirling-number linear combination of just \(f^{(k)}\).

---

## Takeaway

- The correct “fundamental relation” is the Bell-polynomial version:
  \[
  \frac{d^n}{dx^n}\log f(x)
  =
  \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(-1)^{k-1}(k-1)!}{f(x)^k}\,
  B_{n,k}\!\big(f^{(1)}(x),\dots,f^{(n-k+1)}(x)\big).
  \]
- Stirling numbers of the second kind arise as the specialization \(B_{n,k}(1,1,\dots)=S(n,k)\), but they do not replace \(B_{n,k}\) in the general identity.
