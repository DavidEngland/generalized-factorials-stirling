Good — let’s do it cleanly.

I’ll (1) state the Sokhotski–Plemelj (SP) boundary-value/jump formula for the Cauchy integral on a contour, (2) specialize it to the unit circle and the constant density $\varphi\equiv1$, and (3) show how that reproduces the difference between the inside/outside boundary values of the geometric-series kernel $1/(1-z)$ (equivalently the identity you already have with the $\cot$ term). The upshot: the SP jump equals the value of the density at the contour point, and for our simple pole at $z=1$ this shows the inside and outside radial limits differ by exactly $1$.

### 1 — Sokhotski–Plemelj (Cauchy Integral) Statement

Let $\gamma$ be a smooth, simple, closed, oriented contour (take the unit circle $|z|=1$, oriented counterclockwise). For a sufficiently regular density $\varphi(\zeta)$ on $\gamma$, define the Cauchy integral
$$
C\varphi = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{\varphi(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\,d\zeta, \qquad z\notin\gamma.
$$
For $t$ a point on $\gamma$, the non-tangential boundary values (approach from the interior side denoted $+$ and from the exterior side denoted $-$) satisfy the Sokhotski–Plemelj formulas:
$$
C[\varphi]_\pm(t)
= \pm\frac{1}{2}\varphi(t) + \frac{1}{2\pi i}\operatorname{PV}\int_\gamma\frac{\varphi(\zeta)}{\zeta-t}\,d\zeta,
$$
where $\operatorname{PV}$ is the Cauchy principal value. In particular, the jump across the contour is
$$
C[\varphi]_+(t) - C[\varphi]_-(t) = \varphi(t).
$$
This is the canonical SP jump identity: the difference of the two boundary values equals the density at the point.

### 2 — Specialization to the Unit Circle and $\varphi\equiv 1$

Take $\gamma = \{e^{i\tau} : \tau \in [0,2\pi)\}$ and $\varphi(\zeta) \equiv 1$. Then
$$
C1 = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{|\zeta|=1}\frac{1}{\zeta-z}\,d\zeta.
$$
By the residue theorem, for $z$ strictly inside the unit circle the integral equals $1$ ($C1=1$), and for $z$ strictly outside it equals $0$ ($C1=0$). The SP boundary formula then says that for a point $t = e^{i t_0}$ on the circle,
$$
C[1]_\pm(t) = \pm\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2\pi i}\operatorname{PV}\int_{|\zeta|=1}\frac{1}{\zeta-t}\,d\zeta.
$$
By symmetry, the principal-value integral vanishes in this constant-density case (the integrand is odd-symmetric around the point), so the PV term is zero. Thus,
$$
C[1]_+(t) = +\frac{1}{2}, \qquad C[1]_-(t) = -\frac{1}{2},
$$
and the jump
$$
C[1]_+(t) - C[1]_-(t) = 1
$$
agrees with the general SP identity $\varphi(t)=1$.

*(Note: Different sign conventions may yield inside value $1$ and outside value $0$, but the jump is always $\varphi(t)$.)*

### 3 — Connection to the Geometric Series / $1/(1-e^{it})$ Representation

Previously, for $t \not\equiv 0 \pmod{2\pi}$,
$$
\frac{1}{1-e^{it}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{i}{2}\cot\left(\frac{t}{2}\right),
$$
as the distributional/principal-value boundary representation of the inside geometric series $\sum_{n\ge0} e^{int}$. There is also an outside-series representation (Laurent in negative powers)
$$
-\sum_{n\ge1} e^{-int},
$$
whose principal-value boundary representation is
$$
-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{i}{2}\cot\left(\frac{t}{2}\right).
$$
The cotangent part is common to both and encodes the symmetric principal-value singular behavior; the only difference is the $\pm\frac{1}{2}$ constant.

Therefore, the inside minus outside boundary values give
$$
\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{i}{2}\cot\frac{t}{2}\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{i}{2}\cot\frac{t}{2}\right) = 1.
$$
That difference is exactly the SP jump, and equals the density value $\varphi(t)=1$ used in the Cauchy integral formulation.

### 4 — Interpretation in Terms of the Simple Pole at $z=1$

- The cotangent term $\frac{i}{2}\cot(t/2)$ is the shared principal-value part of the boundary values; it reflects the symmetric singular behavior from the kernel.
- The constant $\pm\frac{1}{2}$ pieces are the discontinuous parts of the boundary values; their difference is the jump and matches the SP formula.
- Infinitesimally near the pole at $t=0$ with the local linearization $1-e^{it}\approx -i t$, the real-line distributional identity
  $$
  \frac{1}{x\pm i0} = \operatorname{PV}\frac{1}{x} \mp i\pi\delta(x)
  $$
  is the real-line analogue: the PV part corresponds to the cotangent-like term and the $\pm$ (or $\delta$) part encodes the jump/residue. Pulling back via $x \leftrightarrow t$ (and restoring circle geometry) gives the same structure: a shared PV-type term plus a jump equal to the residue/density.

## Hyperbolic and Trigonometric Connections: cot, tanh, coth, and Their Inverses

The cotangent function $\cot(t/2)$ in the SP formula is closely related to the hyperbolic cotangent $\coth(z)$ via analytic continuation ($t \mapsto iz$). This connection allows us to interpret boundary jumps and inversion properties in terms of hyperbolic functions and their series expansions.

### 1 — Analytic Continuation: cot $\leftrightarrow$ coth

- $\cot(t/2) = -i\,\coth(iz/2)$ for $t=iz$.
- Hyperbolic functions (tanh, coth) and their inverses (artanh, arcoth) have series expansions with odd powers, reflecting their symmetry and connection to operator eigenvalues.

### 2 — Inversion and Domains

- $\operatorname{artanh}(x)$ and $\operatorname{arcoth}(x)$ invert $\tanh$ and $\coth$ respectively.
- For $|x|<1$, $\operatorname{artanh}(x)$ is real and analytic; for $|x|>1$, $\operatorname{arcoth}(x)$ is real and analytic.
- The inversion $x \mapsto 1/x$ swaps the inside and outside domains, analogous to the SP boundary values for the unit circle.

### 3 — Series Expansions and Operator Eigenvalues

- The odd OGF for $\operatorname{artanh}(x)$:
  $$
  \operatorname{artanh}(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}
  $$
  Coefficients $(2n+1)^{-1}$ are eigenvalues of the symmetry operator added for oddness.
- $\operatorname{arcoth}(x)$ has a similar expansion for $|x|>1$.

### 4 — Weighted Logarithms and Rational Functions

- Both $\operatorname{artanh}(x)$ and $\operatorname{arcoth}(x)$ can be written as weighted logarithms of first-degree polynomials:
  $$
  \operatorname{artanh}(x) = \frac{1}{2}\log\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right)
  $$
  $$
  \operatorname{arcoth}(x) = \frac{1}{2}\log\left(\frac{x+1}{x-1}\right)
  $$
- These forms highlight the inversion symmetry: swapping $x$ and $1/x$ exchanges inside and outside domains.

### 5 — Hyperbolic vs Trigonometric: EGF and OGF

- Hyperbolic functions relate to exponential generating functions (EGF), Bernoulli and Euler numbers, and series along imaginary lines.
- Trigonometric functions (tan, cot) relate to ordinary generating functions (OGF) and series on the real line.
- The analytic continuation between cot and coth connects Bernoulli/Euler structures to the SP jump and boundary behavior.

| Function         | Series Domain      | Inverse      | Log Formulation                | Operator/Eigenvalue Connection |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| $\tanh(x)$       | $|x|<1$           | $\operatorname{artanh}(x)$ | $\frac{1}{2}\log\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ | Odd OGF, symmetry operator    |
| $\coth(x)$       | $|x|>1$           | $\operatorname{arcoth}(x)$ | $\frac{1}{2}\log\frac{x+1}{x-1}$ | Odd OGF, symmetry operator    |
| $\cot(z)$        | $z$ real          | —            | —                             | Bernoulli/Euler via series    |
| $\coth(z)$       | $z$ real/imaginary| —            | —                             | Bernoulli/Euler via EGF       |

### 7 — Geometric and Hyperbolic Series: Boundary and Inversion

- The geometric series kernel $1/(1-z)$ and its boundary values (inside/outside unit circle) mirror the inversion properties of $\operatorname{artanh}$ and $\operatorname{arcoth}$.
- Analytic continuation along imaginary lines ($z=it$) connects trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, and their respective series expansions.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Sokhotski–Plemelj Jump for $\varphi(\zeta) = \zeta^n$ on the Unit Circle

Let $\gamma$ be the unit circle and $\varphi(\zeta) = \zeta^n$ for integer $n$.

Compute the Cauchy integral:
$$
C[\zeta^n](z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{|\zeta|=1} \frac{\zeta^n}{\zeta-z}\,d\zeta
$$
- For $|z|<1$, by residue theorem, $C[\zeta^n](z) = z^n$.
- For $|z|>1$, $C[\zeta^n](z) = 0$.

**Boundary values at $t = e^{i t_0}$:**
$$
C[\zeta^n]_+(t) - C[\zeta^n]_-(t) = t^n
$$
This matches the SP jump formula: the difference of boundary values equals the density at the point.

### Example 2: Geometric Series Kernel and Principal Value

Evaluate the boundary values of $1/(1-e^{it})$ as $t \to 0$:

- **Inside boundary ($|z|<1$):**
  $$
  \frac{1}{1-e^{it}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{i}{2}\cot\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)
  $$
- **Outside boundary ($|z|>1$):**
  $$
  -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{i}{2}\cot\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)
  $$
- **Jump:**
  $$
  \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{i}{2}\cot\frac{t}{2}\right) - \left(-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{i}{2}\cot\frac{t}{2}\right) = 1
  $$
This demonstrates the SP jump for the geometric series kernel.

### Example 3: Hyperbolic Analogue—Boundary Values of $\frac{1}{1-x}$ for $x$ Real and $|x|<1$, $|x|>1$

- For $|x|<1$ (inside), expand as a power series:
  $$
  \frac{1}{1-x} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n
  $$
- For $|x|>1$ (outside), expand as a Laurent series:
  $$
  -\sum_{n=1}^\infty x^{-n}
  $$
- **Connection to $\operatorname{artanh}(x)$ and $\operatorname{arcoth}(x)$:**
  - $\operatorname{artanh}(x)$ is analytic for $|x|<1$; $\operatorname{arcoth}(x)$ for $|x|>1$.
  - The inversion $x \mapsto 1/x$ swaps domains, analogous to inside/outside boundary values.

---

### Example 4: Distributional Identity on the Real Line

Show that
$$
\frac{1}{x \pm i0} = \operatorname{PV}\frac{1}{x} \mp i\pi\delta(x)
$$
- The principal value part corresponds to the symmetric singularity (cotangent/coth term).
- The $\delta$ term encodes the jump, matching the SP formula.

---

### Example 5: Series Expansion of $\operatorname{artanh}(x)$

Expand $\operatorname{artanh}(x)$ for $|x|<1$:
$$
\operatorname{artanh}(x) = x + \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} + \cdots
$$
- Coefficients $(2n+1)^{-1}$ are eigenvalues of the odd symmetry operator.
- This series is the OGF for the hyperbolic tangent inverse, illustrating the connection to operator theory.

**These examples illustrate the SP jump, boundary values, series expansions, and connections between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, making the theory concrete for students.**

**Summary:**  
The SP jump formula, cotangent/coth connections, and inversion properties of $\operatorname{artanh}$ and $\operatorname{arcoth}$ all reflect deep symmetries between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, their series, and operator eigenvalues. These structures unify boundary behavior, inversion, and generating functions in both real and imaginary domains.
