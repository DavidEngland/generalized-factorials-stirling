# Generalized Stirling Transfer Coefficients

In mathematics, **Generalized Stirling Transfer Coefficients** are a class of combinatorial numbers that express the linear transformation between generalized factorial polynomials with different increment parameters. These coefficients unify and extend several classical sequences of numbers, including the Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds and the Lah numbers, providing a single framework for analyzing a broad range of polynomial basis transformations.

The theory of generalized Stirling transfer coefficients is a modern development in combinatorics and special function theory, providing a powerful tool for bridging different polynomial representations, such as monomials, rising factorials, and falling factorials.

## Definition

The generalized factorial polynomial, denoted $P(x, a, m)$, is defined as:

$$P(x,a,m) = \prod_{k=0}^{m-1}(x+ka) = x(x+a)(x+2a)\cdots(x+(m-1)a)$$

The **Generalized Stirling Transfer Coefficients**, denoted $S_{m,n}(a,b)$, are defined by the linear expansion of a generalized factorial polynomial with increment $a$ in a basis of generalized factorial polynomials with increment $b$:

$$P(x,a,m) = \sum_{n=0}^{m} S_{m,n}(a,b) \cdot P(x,b,n)$$

Here, $m$ and $n$ are non-negative integers representing the degree of the polynomials, and $a$ and $b$ are the increment parameters. The coefficients $S_{m,n}(a,b)$ form a lower-triangular matrix, as the degree of the polynomial cannot increase during the transformation.

## Relationship to Classical Combinatorial Numbers

The generalized Stirling transfer coefficients are named for their ability to specialize to well-known combinatorial numbers under specific choices of the parameters $a$ and $b$.

### Stirling Numbers of the First Kind

The signed Stirling numbers of the first kind, $s(m,n)$, which express monomials in terms of rising factorials, are a special case of the generalized coefficients where $a=0$ and $b=1$.

$$x^m = \sum_{n=0}^{m} s(m,n) \cdot P(x,1,n) \quad \Rightarrow \quad s(m,n) = S_{m,n}(0,1)$$

This is because the generalized factorial polynomial $P(x,0,m)$ is simply the monomial $x^m$, and $P(x,1,n)$ is the rising factorial, also known as the Pochhammer symbol $(x)_n$.

### Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind

The Stirling numbers of the second kind, $S(m,n)$, express rising factorials in terms of monomials. This corresponds to the inverse transformation of the previous case, where $a=1$ and $b=0$.

$$P(x,1,m) = \sum_{n=0}^{m} S(m,n) \cdot x^n \quad \Rightarrow \quad S(m,n) = S_{m,n}(1,0)$$

### Lah Numbers

Lah numbers, $L(m,n)$, which express rising factorials in terms of falling factorials, are another key special case. Falling factorials are equivalent to generalized factorial polynomials with a negative increment, specifically $P(x,-1,n) = x(x-1)\cdots(x-n+1)$. The Lah numbers are related to the coefficients with $a=1$ and $b=-1$.

$$P(x,1,m) = \sum_{n=0}^{m} (-1)^{m-n}L(m,n) \cdot P(x,-1,n) \quad \Rightarrow \quad S_{m,n}(1,-1) = (-1)^{m-n}L(m,n)$$

## Properties

### Orthogonality

A key property of these coefficients is that the transformation from increment $a$ to $b$ is the inverse of the transformation from $b$ to $a$. In matrix form, if $\mathbf{S}(a,b)$ is the matrix with entries $S_{m,n}(a,b)$, then:

$$\mathbf{S}(a,b) \cdot \mathbf{S}(b,a) = \mathbf{I}$$

This generalizes the well-known orthogonality of the Stirling numbers of the first and second kind.

### Recurrence Relation

The coefficients satisfy a recurrence relation that generalizes the classical recurrences. The derivation starts from the polynomial recurrence $P(x,a,m+1) = (x+ma)P(x,a,m)$. By expanding both sides in the $b$-basis and equating coefficients, one obtains the general recurrence relation:

$$S_{m+1, n}(a, b) = S_{m, n-1}(a,b) + (n b + m a)S_{m, n}(a,b)$$

with boundary conditions $S_{m,0}(a,b)$ and $S_{m,m}(a,b)=1$.

### Composition Law

The transformations can be composed. For any three increment parameters $a, b,$ and $c$, the transformation from $a$ to $c$ can be performed by first transforming from $a$ to $b$ and then from $b$ to $c$:

$$\sum_{k=0}^{m} S_{m,k}(a,b) \cdot S_{k,n}(b,c) = S_{m,n}(a,c)$$

This property confirms that the set of all such transformations forms a group under matrix multiplication.

## Applications

* **Combinatorics**: They are used to solve enumeration problems involving permutations and partitions with generalized constraints.
* **Special Function Theory**: The coefficients facilitate the transformation between different polynomial bases, which is fundamental in the study of orthogonal polynomials and hypergeometric functions.
* **Numerical Analysis**: They can be used for numerical interpolation, series acceleration, and finite difference methods.
