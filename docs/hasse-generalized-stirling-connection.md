# Connecting the Hasse Operator to Generalized Stirling Numbers

This document explores the relationship between the Hasse operator and the framework of generalized Stirling numbers, leveraging the connection to finite differences and unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind.

## 1. Review of Key Connections

The Hasse operator can be expressed in terms of finite differences and Stirling numbers of the first kind:

$$\mathcal{H}_m = \frac{1}{m+1} \sum_{j=0}^{m} s(m,j) \frac{\Delta^j}{j!}$$

where $s(m,j)$ are the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind, and $\Delta$ is the forward difference operator.

The Hsu-Shiue generalized Stirling numbers $S(n,k;\alpha,\beta,r)$ unify various Stirling-type numbers through the recurrence relation:

$$S(n,k;\alpha,\beta,r) = S(n-1,k-1;\alpha,\beta,r) + (\beta k - \alpha n + r)S(n-1,k;\alpha,\beta,r)$$

## 2. The Hasse Operator as a Generalized Stirling Transform

### 2.1 Representation via Generalized Stirling Numbers

The action of the Hasse operator on powers of $x$ produces scaled Bernoulli polynomials:

$$\mathcal{H}(x^n) = \frac{B_n(x)}{n!}$$

This can be reformulated in terms of generalized Stirling numbers. Specifically:

$$\mathcal{H}(x^n) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} S(n,k;0,1,0) \frac{B_k(x)}{k!}$$

where $S(n,k;0,1,0)$ are the Stirling numbers of the second kind. This showcases how the Hasse operator transforms between different polynomial bases.

### 2.2 Umbral Calculus Perspective

In umbral calculus, both the Hasse operator and generalized Stirling numbers operate as linear functionals on polynomial spaces. The representation:

$$\mathcal{H}_m = \frac{1}{m+1} \sum_{j=0}^{m} s(m,j) \frac{\Delta^j}{j!}$$

can be viewed as an umbral composition of the Stirling functional and the finite difference functional.

This perspective allows us to establish that:

$$\mathcal{H}(x^n) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} S(n,k;1,-1,0) \frac{B_k(x)}{k!}$$

where $S(n,k;1,-1,0)$ are related to the signed Stirling numbers of the first kind.

## 3. Finite Difference Representation of Generalized Stirling Numbers

### 3.1 Difference Operator Expression

Using the connection between the Hasse operator and finite differences, we can express generalized Stirling numbers in terms of difference operators:

$$S(n,k;\alpha,\beta,0) = \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{j=0}^{n} c_{n,j}(\alpha,\beta) \Delta^j(x^k)|_{x=0}$$

where the coefficients $c_{n,j}(\alpha,\beta)$ depend on the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

### 3.2 Operational Formula

This leads to an operational formula connecting the Hasse operator to generalized Stirling numbers:

$$\mathcal{H}(P_{\alpha,\beta}(x,n)) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} S(n,k;\alpha,\beta,0) \frac{B_k(x)}{k!}$$

where $P_{\alpha,\beta}(x,n)$ is a parametric polynomial of degree $n$ determined by $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

## 4. Applications to Special Cases

### 4.1 Whitney Numbers

For the Whitney numbers of the first kind $w_m(r,n)$, which are a special case of generalized Stirling numbers:

$$w_m(r,n) = S(n,k;-m,0,0)$$

We can express the action of the Hasse operator on these numbers:

$$\mathcal{H}(w_m(r,x)) = \sum_{j=0}^{r} \frac{(-1)^{r-j}}{(r-j)!} w_m(j,x) B_{r-j}(x)$$

### 4.2 r-Lah Numbers

For r-Lah numbers $L_r(n,k)$, which correspond to $S(n,k;-r,r,0)$, we have:

$$\mathcal{H}(L_r(n,x)) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} \binom{n}{j} r^{n-j} \frac{B_j(x)}{j!}$$

This provides a new computational approach to r-Lah numbers using the Hasse operator.

## 5. Towards a Unified Framework

### 5.1 The Hasse-Stirling Operator

We can define a generalized operator that encompasses both the Hasse operator and generalized Stirling numbers:

$$\mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}(f)(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \sum_{n=0}^{m} H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} f(x+n)$$

where $H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}$ are modified Hasse coefficients parameterized by $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $r$.

### 5.2 Recurrence and Explicit Formula

These modified coefficients satisfy:

$$H_{m+1,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} = H_{m,n-1}^{\alpha,\beta,r} - \frac{m\alpha + n\beta + r}{m+2} H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r}$$

with the explicit formula:

$$H_{m,n}^{\alpha,\beta,r} = \frac{1}{m+1} \sum_{j=0}^{n} (-1)^{n-j} \binom{n}{j} S(m,j;\alpha,\beta,r)$$

## 6. Conclusion

The connection between the Hasse operator and generalized Stirling numbers through finite differences and Stirling numbers of the first kind provides a powerful unifying framework. This relationship allows us to:

1. Express generalized Stirling numbers through the Hasse operator
2. Develop new computational methods for special cases of generalized Stirling numbers
3. Establish transformations between different polynomial bases
4. Create a parameterized version of the Hasse operator that includes generalized Stirling numbers

This synthesis not only deepens our understanding of these mathematical structures but also provides practical tools for computation and further theoretical development.
