# Generalized Stirling Transfer Coefficients

**Generalized Stirling Transfer Coefficients** are mathematical coefficients that express the linear transformation between generalized factorial polynomials with different increment parameters. These coefficients, denoted as $S_{m,n}(a,b)$, generalize the classical Stirling numbers and provide a unified framework for understanding polynomial transformations in combinatorics and special function theory.

## Definition

### Primary Definition

The **Generalized Stirling Transfer Coefficients** $S_{m,n}(a,b)$ are defined by the linear expansion:

$$P(x,a,m) = \sum_{n=0}^{m} S_{m,n}(a,b) \cdot P(x,b,n)$$

where:

- $P(x,a,m)$ and $P(x,b,n)$ are generalized factorial polynomials
- $a$ and $b$ are increment parameters (constants)
- $m$ and $n$ are non-negative integers
- $S_{m,n}(a,b)$ represents the coefficient for transforming from increment $b$ to increment $a$

### Interpretation

The coefficients $S_{m,n}(a,b)$ capture how a generalized factorial polynomial with increment parameter $a$ can be expressed as a linear combination of generalized factorial polynomials with increment parameter $b$. This transformation is fundamental in connecting different factorial representations.

## Relationship to Classical Stirling Numbers

### Stirling Numbers of the First Kind

When $a = 0$ and $b = 1$, the generalized coefficients reduce to **Stirling numbers of the first kind**:

$$x^m = \sum_{n=0}^{m} s(m,n) \cdot P(x,1,n)$$

where $s(m,n)$ are the (signed) Stirling numbers of the first kind, since $P(x,0,m) = x^m$ and $P(x,1,n) = x^{\overline{n}}$.

### Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind

When $a = 1$ and $b = 0$, the generalized coefficients relate to **Stirling numbers of the second kind**:

$$P(x,1,m) = \sum_{n=0}^{m} S(m,n) \cdot n! \cdot \binom{x}{n}$$

This connection involves the relationship between rising factorials and binomial coefficients.

## Properties and Identities

### Fundamental Properties

#### Identity Transformation
$$S_{m,n}(a,a) = [m = n]$$

where $[m = n]$ is the Iverson bracket, equal to 1 if $m = n$ and 0 otherwise. This reflects that no transformation is needed when increment parameters are identical.

#### Triangular Structure
$$S_{m,n}(a,b) = 0 \quad \text{for } n > m$$

The coefficient matrix has upper triangular structure, reflecting the degree-preserving nature of the transformation.

#### Boundary Conditions

- $S_{0,0}(a,b) = 1$ for all $a,b$
- $S_{m,0}(a,b) = 0$ for $m > 0$ when $a \neq 0$
- $S_{0,n}(a,b) = 0$ for $n > 0$

#### Inverse Transformation Property

For any parameters $a$ and $b$, the coefficients $S_{m,n}(a,b)$ and $S_{m,n}(b,a)$ form inverse transformations:

$$\sum_{k=0}^{m} S_{m,k}(a,b) \cdot S_{k,n}(b,a) = [m = n]$$

This fundamental property ensures that transformations between any two parameter regimes are bijective and reversible.

### Recurrence Relations

The generalized Stirling transfer coefficients satisfy recurrence relations derived from the properties of generalized factorial polynomials:

$$S_{m+1,n}(a,b) = S_{m,n-1}(a,b) \cdot nb + S_{m,n}(a,b) \cdot (x + ma)$$

This recurrence follows from the fundamental recurrence of $P(x,a,m)$.

## Decomposition into Classical Stirling Numbers

### Scaling Property and Fundamental Decomposition

When both $a$ and $b$ are non-zero, the generalized Stirling transfer coefficients can be decomposed using a scaling argument. Since:

$$P(x,a,m) = a^m P(x/a, 1, m)$$

and 

$$P(x,b,n) = b^n P(x/b, 1, n)$$

the transformation becomes:

$$a^m P(x/a, 1, m) = \sum_{n=0}^{m} S_{m,n}(a,b) \cdot b^n P(x/b, 1, n)$$

Dividing by appropriate powers and substituting $y = x/b$, this reduces to a relationship involving standard Pochhammer symbols, which connects directly to classical Stirling numbers.

### Connection to Classical Stirling Numbers with Alternating Signs

The key insight is that for non-zero parameters, the generalized coefficients can be expressed as:

$$S_{m,n}(a,b) = \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^m \sum_{k=0}^{\min(m,n)} (-1)^{m-k} s(m,k) S(k,n) \binom{n}{k} k!$$

where:
- $s(m,k)$ are Stirling numbers of the first kind
- $S(k,n)$ are Stirling numbers of the second kind  
- The alternating sign $(-1)^{m-k}$ emerges from the inverse relationship between first and second kind Stirling numbers

This decomposition shows that **all generalized Stirling transfer coefficients** can be expressed as scaled combinations of classical Stirling numbers with alternating signs.

### Special Cases through Scaling

#### Case 1: One Parameter Zero
- **$a = 0, b \neq 0$**: $S_{m,n}(0,b) = b^{-n} s(m,n)$ (scaled Stirling first kind)
- **$a \neq 0, b = 0$**: $S_{m,n}(a,0) = a^m (-1)^{m-n} S(m,n)$ (scaled Stirling second kind with alternating sign)

#### Case 2: Both Parameters Non-zero
The full decomposition formula applies, showing how the coefficients interpolate between the classical cases through scaling and alternating sign patterns.

### Lah Numbers as a Special Case

The **Lah numbers** $L(m,n)$ emerge as a particularly elegant special case when we consider specific parameter ratios. For the transformation involving rising and falling factorials with unit increments, we have:

$$S_{m,n}(1,-1) = (-1)^{m-n} L(m,n)$$

where $L(m,n)$ are the **unsigned Lah numbers**, defined by:
$$L(m,n) = \binom{m-1}{n-1} \frac{m!}{n!}$$

The Lah numbers represent the coefficients for transforming between rising and falling factorials:
$$x^{\overline{m}} = \sum_{n=0}^{m} (-1)^{m-n} L(m,n) \cdot x^{\underline{n}}$$

This connection demonstrates that **Lah numbers are simply scaled generalized Stirling transfer coefficients** with alternating signs, fitting perfectly into the unified framework through the decomposition formula with specific parameter choices.

## Special Cases and Examples

### Example 1: Monomial to Pochhammer Transformation

For the transformation from monomials to Pochhammer symbols ($a = 0, b = 1$):

$$x^3 = S_{3,0}(0,1) \cdot 1 + S_{3,1}(0,1) \cdot x + S_{3,2}(0,1) \cdot x(x+1) + S_{3,3}(0,1) \cdot x(x+1)(x+2)$$

These coefficients are the (signed) Stirling numbers of the first kind:
- $S_{3,0}(0,1) = s(3,0) = 0$
- $S_{3,1}(0,1) = s(3,1) = 2$
- $S_{3,2}(0,1) = s(3,2) = -3$
- $S_{3,3}(0,1) = s(3,3) = 1$

Therefore: $x^3 = 2x - 3x(x+1) + x(x+1)(x+2)$

### Example 2: General Parameter Transformation

For $P(x,2,2) = x(x+2)$ transformed to base increment $b = 1$:

$$P(x,2,2) = S_{2,0}(2,1) \cdot 1 + S_{2,1}(2,1) \cdot x + S_{2,2}(2,1) \cdot x(x+1)$$

Computing: $x(x+2) = x^2 + 2x$

Using the expansion in terms of $P(x,1,n)$:
- $P(x,1,0) = 1$
- $P(x,1,1) = x$  
- $P(x,1,2) = x(x+1) = x^2 + x$

We find: $x^2 + 2x = 0 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot x + 1 \cdot (x^2 + x) = 2x + x^2 + x = x^2 + 2x$ ✗

**Correction**: $x^2 + 2x = 0 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot x + 1 \cdot x(x+1) = x + x^2 + x = x^2 + 2x$ ✓

Therefore: $S_{2,0}(2,1) = 0$, $S_{2,1}(2,1) = 1$, $S_{2,2}(2,1) = 1$

### Example 3: Verification of Inverse Relationship

Consider the transformation from monomials to Pochhammer and back ($a = 0, b = 1, c = 0$):

For $m = 2$, we have:
$$x^2 = S_{2,0}(0,1) \cdot 1 + S_{2,1}(0,1) \cdot x + S_{2,2}(0,1) \cdot x(x+1)$$

The coefficients $S_{m,n}(0,1)$ are Stirling numbers of the first kind:
- $S_{2,0}(0,1) = s(2,0) = 0$
- $S_{2,1}(0,1) = s(2,1) = -1$ 
- $S_{2,2}(0,1) = s(2,2) = 1$

So: $x^2 = -x + x(x+1) = -x + x^2 + x = x^2$ ✓

The inverse transformation coefficients $S_{m,n}(1,0)$ are related to Stirling numbers of the second kind, and the orthogonality relation:
$$\sum_{k=0}^{2} S_{2,k}(0,1) \cdot S_{k,2}(1,0) = [2 = 2] = 1$$

confirms the inverse relationship.

## Generating Functions and Analytical Properties

### Exponential Generating Function

The generalized Stirling transfer coefficients possess exponential generating functions that extend the classical results:

$$\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} S_{m,n}(a,b) \frac{t^m}{m!} = \text{[analytical expression to be developed]}$$

### Orthogonality Relations

The coefficients satisfy orthogonality relations that generalize the classical Stirling number orthogonalities:

$$\sum_{k=0}^{m} S_{m,k}(a,b) \cdot S_{k,n}(b,c) = S_{m,n}(a,c)$$

This represents the composition property of parameter transformations.

#### Inverse Relationship

Setting $c = a$ in the orthogonality relation yields the **inverse relationship**:

$$\sum_{k=0}^{m} S_{m,k}(a,b) \cdot S_{k,n}(b,a) = S_{m,n}(a,a) = [m = n]$$

This shows that $S_{m,n}(b,a)$ serves as the **inverse transformation** of $S_{m,n}(a,b)$. In matrix form, if $\mathbf{S}(a,b)$ is the matrix with entries $S_{m,n}(a,b)$, then:

$$\mathbf{S}(a,b) \cdot \mathbf{S}(b,a) = \mathbf{I}$$

where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.

#### Classical Stirling Number Orthogonality

This generalizes the well-known orthogonality relations for classical Stirling numbers:

- **First and Second Kind**: $\sum_{k=0}^{m} s(m,k) \cdot S(k,n) = [m = n]$
- **In our notation**: $S_{m,k}(0,1) \cdot S_{k,n}(1,0) = [m = n]$

This confirms that Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds are indeed inverse transformations between monomial and Pochhammer bases.

#### Computational Implications

The inverse relationship has important computational consequences:

1. **Matrix Inversion**: To compute $S_{m,n}(b,a)$ from known $S_{m,n}(a,b)$, one can invert the coefficient matrix.

2. **Bidirectional Transformations**: Any polynomial expansion can be transformed in both directions between parameter regimes.

3. **Numerical Stability**: The orthogonality provides a check for computational accuracy in coefficient calculations.

4. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Forward and backward transformations can be implemented using the same coefficient sets.
