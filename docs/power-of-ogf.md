# The Power of an Ordinary Generating Function

## Abstract

We investigate the expansion of $[f(x)]^z$ where $f(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \alpha_m x^m$ is an ordinary generating function with $f(0) = \alpha_0 \neq 0$. This expansion yields a fundamental connection between falling factorial polynomials $P(z,-1,m)$, normalized graded Bell polynomials $\beta_{m,k}$, and generating function coefficients, providing a unified framework for coefficient extraction and combinatorial interpretation.

## 1. Setup and Motivation

### 1.1 The Central Problem

Given an ordinary generating function:
$$f(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \alpha_m x^m \quad \text{with } \alpha_0 \neq 0$$

we seek to understand the expansion of its $z$-th power:
$$[f(x)]^z = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n(z) x^n$$

The coefficients $c_n(z)$ encode rich combinatorial and analytical information, and our goal is to express them in terms of fundamental mathematical objects.

### 1.2 Key Insight: Normalization

Without loss of generality, we can factor out the constant term:
$$f(x) = \alpha_0 \left(1 + \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \frac{\alpha_m}{\alpha_0} x^m\right) = \alpha_0 g(x)$$

where $g(x) = 1 + \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} a_m x^m$ with $a_m = \alpha_m/\alpha_0$.

Therefore:
$$[f(x)]^z = \alpha_0^z [g(x)]^z$$

This normalization is crucial because it separates the scaling factor $\alpha_0^z$ from the structural information contained in $[g(x)]^z$.

## 2. The Main Theorem: Power Expansion Formula

### 2.1 Statement of the Main Result

**Theorem 2.1 (OGF Power Expansion).** Let $f(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \alpha_m x^m$ with $\alpha_0 \neq 0$. Then:

$$\boxed{[x^m] [f(x)]^z = \alpha_0^{z-m} \sum_{k=0}^{m} P(z,-1,k) \beta_{m,k}\left(\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_0}, \frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_0}, \frac{\alpha_3}{\alpha_0}, \ldots\right)}$$

where:
- $P(z,-1,k) = z(z-1)(z-2)\cdots(z-k+1)$ is the falling factorial polynomial
- $\beta_{m,k}(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots)$ are the normalized graded Bell polynomials

### 2.2 Derivation via Multinomial Theorem

The expansion follows from the generalized multinomial theorem applied to:
$$[g(x)]^z = \left(1 + \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} a_j x^j\right)^z$$

Using the multinomial expansion:
$$[g(x)]^z = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \binom{z}{k} \left(\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} a_j x^j\right)^k$$

The term $\left(\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} a_j x^j\right)^k$ generates all ways to select $k$ terms from the infinite sum, which corresponds exactly to partitions counted by Bell polynomials.

### 2.3 Coefficient Extraction

The coefficient of $x^m$ in $[g(x)]^z$ is:
$$[x^m] [g(x)]^z = \sum_{k=0}^{m} \binom{z}{k} \beta_{m,k}(a_1, a_2, \ldots)$$

Using the identity $\binom{z}{k} = \frac{P(z,-1,k)}{k!}$ and the normalization property of $\beta$ polynomials:
$$[x^m] [g(x)]^z = \sum_{k=0}^{m} \frac{P(z,-1,k)}{k!} \beta_{m,k}(a_1, a_2, \ldots)$$

## 3. The Bell Polynomial Connection

### 3.1 Normalized Graded Bell Polynomials

The normalized graded Bell polynomials $\beta_{m,k}$ are defined by the recurrence:
$$\beta_{m,k}(a_1, a_2, \ldots) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=1}^{m-k+1} a_j \beta_{m-j, k-1}(a_1, a_2, \ldots)$$

with boundary conditions:
- $\beta_{0,0} = 1$
- $\beta_{m,0} = 0$ for $m > 0$ 
- $\beta_{m,k} = 0$ for $k > m$

### 3.2 Combinatorial Interpretation

Each term $\beta_{m,k}(a_1, a_2, \ldots)$ counts weighted partitions of the integer $m$ into exactly $k$ parts, where:
- Parts of size $j$ have weight $a_j$
- The normalization factor $1/k$ accounts for the unlabeled nature of the parts
- The sum runs over all valid partition structures

### 3.3 Connection to Exponential Bell Polynomials

The relationship to exponential Bell polynomials $B_{m,k}$ is:
$$B_{m,k}(a_1, a_2, \ldots) = k! \sum_{\text{partitions}} \frac{1}{\prod_j m_j!} \beta_{m,k}(\text{scaled weights})$$

This shows that graded Bell polynomials capture the "unweighted" combinatorial structure.

## 4. Explicit Formula and Computational Aspects

### 4.1 The Complete Expansion

Combining all elements, the coefficient of $x^m$ in $[f(x)]^z$ is:

$$\boxed{[x^m] [f(x)]^z = \alpha_0^{z-m} \sum_{k=0}^{m} P(z,-1,k) \beta_{m,k}\left(\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_0}, \frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_0}, \frac{\alpha_3}{\alpha_0}, \ldots\right)}$$

### 4.2 Special Cases

**Case 1: Geometric Series**
If $f(x) = \frac{1}{1-ax} = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} a^m x^m$, then $\alpha_0 = 1$ and $\alpha_m/\alpha_0 = a$ for all $m \geq 1$.

The expansion becomes:
$$\left(\frac{1}{1-ax}\right)^z = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} P(z,-1,k) \beta_{m,k}(a, a, a, \ldots) x^m$$

Since all weights are equal, $\beta_{m,k}(a, a, \ldots) = a^m \delta_{k,m}$ (only the "all singleton" partition contributes), giving:
$$\left(\frac{1}{1-ax}\right)^z = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} P(z,-1,m) a^m x^m = (1-ax)^{-z}$$

This recovers the binomial series, confirming our formula.

**Case 2: Polynomial Case $f(x) = 1 + cx$**
When only $\alpha_0 = 1$ and $\alpha_1 = c$ are non-zero:
$$[x^m](1+cx)^z = \sum_{k=0}^{m} P(z,-1,k) \beta_{m,k}(c, 0, 0, \ldots)$$

Only $\beta_{1,1}(c, 0, 0, \ldots) = c$ contributes, recovering the standard binomial expansion.

### 4.3 Computational Algorithm

```
function ogf_power_coefficient(alpha_sequence, z, m):
    # Normalize the sequence
    a_sequence = [alpha[k]/alpha[0] for k in 1..âˆž]
    
    result = 0
    for k = 0 to m:
        falling_factorial = falling_factorial_P(z, -1, k)
        bell_term = beta(m, k, a_sequence)
        result += falling_factorial * bell_term
    
    return alpha[0]^(z-m) * result
```

where $P_q$ are q-falling factorials and $\beta^{(q)}$ are q-Bell polynomials.

## 8. Conclusion

1. **Falling factorial polynomials** - encoding the algebraic structure
2. **Normalized graded Bell polynomials** - capturing combinatorial constraints  
3. **Generating function coefficients** - providing the weights

This trinity reveals deep connections between combinatorics, special functions, and generating function theory. The explicit formula $[f(x)]^z = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \alpha_0^{z-m} P(z,-1,m) \beta_{m,k}(a_1, a_2, \ldots) x^m$ serves as both a computational tool and a theoretical bridge between discrete and continuous mathematics.

The framework's power lies not just in coefficient calculation, but in revealing the underlying mathematical structures that govern generating function behavior. As demonstrated through applications in probability, combinatorics, and mathematical physics, this approach provides both practical computational advantages and deep theoretical insights.
