## üîç Strengths of the Draft

- **Clear mathematical structure:** The definitions of \(\Lambda_k(n)\), \(\Psi_k(x)\), and the use of Mellin inversion are precise and pedagogically sound.
- **Explicit formulas:** The boxed expressions for \(\Lambda_k(p^r)\), Stieltjes constants \(\gamma_m\), and the residue contributions are excellent for student reference.
- **Computational guidance:** Section 4 gives a practical roadmap for numerical experiments, which is ideal for student engagement.
- **Peer-review additions:** The derivation of the residue at a simple zero and the closed-form for \(P_k(\rho,\log x)\) are especially helpful. They bridge the gap between theory and computation.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Suggestions for Enhancement

### 1. **Add a visual summary table**
Include a table summarizing the key formulas for \(\Lambda_k(n)\), \(\Psi_k(x)\), and the main expansion. This helps students quickly reference the hierarchy levels and their associated terms.

| \(k\) | \(\Lambda_k(p^r)\) | Main term in \(\Psi_k(x)\) | Zero contribution |
|------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| 0    | \(\log p\)          | \(x - \gamma_0 x\)          | \(-x^\rho/\rho\)  |
| 1    | \((\log p)^2 r\)    | \(x\log x - \gamma_0 x - \gamma_1 x\) | \(x^\rho P_1(\rho,\log x)\) |
| 2    | \((\log p)^3 r^2\)  | \(x(\log x)^2 - \cdots\)    | \(x^\rho P_2(\rho,\log x)\) |

### 2. **Bridge to analytic number theory**
Add a short paragraph connecting this work to classical prime-counting functions like \(\pi(x)\), \(\theta(x)\), and \(\psi(x)\), and how \(\Psi_k(x)\) generalizes \(\psi(x)\) with logarithmic weights.

### 3. **Highlight the role of RH**
Consider a boxed remark explaining how the Riemann Hypothesis affects the error term and the behavior of the oscillatory sum. This helps students appreciate the conditional nature of the bounds.

## üß† Bonus Ideas for Student Exploration

- **Explore the behavior of \(\Psi_k(x)\) for large \(k\):** How does the dominance of \((\log x)^k\) affect the convergence and error terms?
- **Compare \(\Psi_k(x)\) with smoothed versions:** Introduce a smoothed sum like \(\sum_{n\le x} \Lambda_k(n) w(n/x)\) for a weight function \(w\), and explore how it affects the zero contributions.
- **Investigate cumulant interpretations:** Since \(\Lambda_k(n)\) resembles cumulants in probability, students could explore analogies with moment-generating functions.
