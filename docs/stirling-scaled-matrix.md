The 3×3 matrix with entries |s(i,j)|·a^(i-j) is:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
a & 1 & 0 \\
2a^2 & 3a & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where:
- |s(i,j)| is the unsigned Stirling number of the first kind
- a is a parameter
- i is the row index (1 to 3)
- j is the column index (1 to 3)

The inverse of this matrix is:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
-a & 1 & 0 \\
a^2 & -3a & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Note that the inverse matrix contains entries (-1)^(i-j)·S(i,j)·a^(i-j), where S(i,j) are the Stirling numbers of the second kind. This pattern matches what we expect when transforming between these factorial bases.

For clarification:
- The original matrix scales unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind by a^(i-j)
- The inverse matrix scales Stirling numbers of the second kind by (-1)^(i-j)·a^(i-j)
- This preserves the orthogonality relationship between these Stirling numbers
