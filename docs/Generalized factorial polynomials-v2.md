**Generalized factorial polynomials** extend the concept of factorial functions by introducing a parameter that controls the increment between consecutive terms. This document explores the definition, properties, and applications of generalized factorial polynomialsâ€”a powerful mathematical tool that unifies several classic mathematical objects like the Pochhammer symbol and simple monomials.

### Definition

The **generalized factorial polynomial**, denoted as $P(x,a,m)$, is a mathematical function that generalizes the concept of rising and falling factorials by incorporating an increment parameter, $a$. It's defined as the product of $m$ terms, where each term increases by $a$:

$$P(x,a,m) = x(x+a)(x+2a)\cdots(x+(m-1)a).$$

Here, $x$ is a variable, $a$ is a constant increment, and $m$ is a non-negative integer representing the degree of the polynomial. When $m=0$, the polynomial is defined as the empty product, $P(x,a,0) = 1$.

This definition provides a unified framework for several key mathematical objects:

* **Pochhammer Symbol** (Rising Factorial): When the increment parameter $a = 1$, the function becomes the standard Pochhammer symbol, also known as the rising factorial:
    $$P(x,1,m) = x^{\overline{m}} = x(x+1)(x+2)\cdots(x+m-1).$$

* **Monomial**: When the increment parameter $a = 0$, the definition simplifies to the monomial $x^m$, where all increments vanish:
    $$P(x,0,m) = x \cdot x \cdots x = x^m.$$

* **Falling Factorial**: The generalized falling factorial is closely related and can be expressed in terms of the generalized rising factorial:
    $$x^{\underline{m}}_a = x(x-a)\cdots(x-(m-1)a) = P(x-a(m-1), a, m).$$

The unified nature of generalized factorial polynomials is elegantly captured by an Iverson bracket notation:

$$P(x,a,m) = [a=0]x^m + [a \neq 0]a^m \frac{\Gamma(x/a+m)}{\Gamma(x/a)}$$

This single expression effectively "switches" between the monomial case ($a=0$) and the more general gamma function representation for all other values of $a$.

### Properties and Identities

Generalized factorial polynomials possess a rich set of properties that connect them to other areas of mathematics.

#### Recurrence Relations

The polynomials follow a simple and fundamental recurrence relation:

$$P(x,a,m+1) = P(x,a,m) \cdot (x + ma)$$

This property is a direct result of the definition and is essential for both theoretical and computational work.

#### Connection to the Gamma Function

For a non-zero increment $a$, the generalized factorial polynomial can be expressed using the gamma function, which provides an analytic continuation for non-integer values of $m$:

$$P(x,a,m) = a^m \frac{\Gamma(x/a + m)}{\Gamma(x/a)}.$$

This expression is not applicable when $a=0$.

#### Derivatives

The derivative of $P(x,a,m)$ with respect to $x$ reveals a deep connection to the **digamma function**, $\psi(x)$, which is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function.

For the general case ($a \neq 0$):
$$\frac{d}{dx} P(x,a,m) = P(x,a,m) \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \frac{1}{x + ak}$$

This can also be written in terms of the digamma function:
$$\frac{d}{dx} P(x,a,m) = \frac{P(x,a,m)}{a} \left[\psi\left(\frac{x}{a} + m\right) - \psi\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)\right]$$

For the monomial case ($a=0$), the derivative is simply the standard power rule:
$$\frac{d}{dx} P(x,0,m) = m x^{m-1}.$$

### Applications

Generalized factorial polynomials are not just a theoretical curiosity; they have practical applications across several fields of mathematics.

* **Finite Difference Calculus**: In discrete mathematics, these polynomials act as the equivalent of power functions in continuous calculus, simplifying expressions involving finite differences.
* **Special Functions**: They are a fundamental component in the series expansions of hypergeometric functions, which are a vast class of special functions crucial in mathematical physics and engineering.
* **Combinatorics**: The standard rising and falling factorials (where $a = \pm 1$) are used to count permutations and combinations.
* **Numerical Analysis**: These polynomials are used to construct interpolation formulas, such as Newton's forward and backward difference formulas, for approximating functions at points within a given data set.
