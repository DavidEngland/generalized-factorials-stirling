## Special Cases

### Case: \( S_{m,n}(0, b) \)

When the increment \( a = 0 \), the generalized Stirling numbers simplify:

\[
S_{m,n}(0, b) = S(m, n) \, b^{m-n}
\]

where \( S(m, n) \) are the (classical) Stirling numbers of the second kind. This reflects that the transformation reduces to the standard Stirling numbers, scaled by \( b^{m-n} \).

### Example Matrix for \( S_{m,n}(0, b) \) (General \( b \))

For \( m, n = 0, 1, 2, 3 \) and any \( b \), the matrix \( S_{m,n}(0, b) \) can be written as:

\[
S_{m,n}(0, b) = S(m, n) \, b^{m-n}
\]

This means the matrix is the usual Stirling matrix of the second kind, multiplied on the right by a diagonal matrix of powers of \( b \):

\[
S_{m,n}(0, b) = S(m, n) \cdot \operatorname{diag}(b^{m-n})
\]

Or, equivalently, you can factor out the powers of \( b \) as a vector:

\[
S_{m,n}(0, b) = S(m, n) \cdot \left[1, b, b^2, b^3, \ldots \right]^{\text{diag}}
\]

where the diagonal scaling multiplies each column \( n \) by \( b^{-n} \) (or, equivalently, each row \( m \) by \( b^m \)), depending on convention.

### Inverse when \( a \neq 0 \), \( b = 0 \)

In this case, the inverse transformation is

\[
S^{-1}_{m,n}(a, 0) = s(m, n) \, a^{m-n}
\]

where \( s(m, n) \) are the (classical, signed) Stirling numbers of the first kind.

In terms of the **unsigned** Stirling numbers of the first kind, denoted by square brackets \(\left[ \begin{array}{c} m \\ n \end{array} \right]\), the formula becomes:

\[
S^{-1}_{m,n}(a, 0) = \left[ \begin{array}{c} m \\ n \end{array} \right] a^{m-n}
\]

Similarly, for the Stirling numbers of the second kind (unsigned, curly brackets):

\[
S_{m,n}(0, b) = \left\{ \begin{array}{c} m \\ n \end{array} \right\} b^{m-n}
\]

where \(\left[ \begin{array}{c} m \\ n \end{array} \right]\) and \(\left\{ \begin{array}{c} m \\ n \end{array} \right\}\) denote the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first and second kind, respectively.

> **Note:** The signed Stirling numbers of the first kind, \( s(m, n) \), relate to the unsigned by \( s(m, n) = (-1)^{m-n} \left[ \begin{array}{c} m \\ n \end{array} \right] \).
