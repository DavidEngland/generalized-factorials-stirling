# Alternative Transfer Coefficients - DEPRECATED

**WARNING: This document contains mathematical errors and is deprecated.**

The T-coefficient approach described in this document has fundamental flaws:

1. **Failed numerical verification** - The computed coefficients do not produce correct transformations
2. **Inconsistent derivations** - Multiple approaches yield different results
3. **Unresolved discrepancies** - Acknowledged errors that were never fixed

**This approach is abandoned.** The standard generalized Stirling transfer coefficients $S_{m,n}(a,b)$ provide the correct framework for polynomial basis transformations.

For correct information, see:
- `generalized-stirling-transfer-coefficients.md`
- `generalized-factorial-polynomials.md`
- `cheat-sheet.md`

**Key Lesson**: In mathematics, every claim must be verified through multiple independent methods. When verification fails consistently, the approach must be abandoned, not patched.
