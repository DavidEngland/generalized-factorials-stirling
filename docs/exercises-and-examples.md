# Exercises and Examples for Generalized Stirling Clustering

This document provides worked examples and exercises to help build intuition for the $(a,b)$-parameterized framework and generalized Stirling numbers.

## 1. Numerical Examples

### Example 1.1: Computing Generalized Stirling Numbers

Calculate $S(5,3,a,b)$ for different parameter values:

| Parameters $(a,b)$ | Formula | Computation | Result |
|-------------------|---------|-------------|--------|
| $(0,1)$ | Classical $S(5,3)$ | $S(5,3) = 10$ | 10 |
| $(1,0)$ | First kind $s(5,3)$ | $s(5,3) = 35$ | 35 |
| $(0,1/2)$ | Hyperbolic strip | $2^{3-5}S(5,3) = 2^{-2} \cdot 10 = 10/4$ | 2.5 |
| $(0,-1/2)$ | Hyperbolic strip | $(-1)^{5-3}2^{3-5}S(5,3) = (-1)^{2}2^{-2} \cdot 10 = 10/4$ | 2.5 |

### Example 1.2: Recurrence Relation Application

Using the recurrence relation $S(n,k,a,b) = S(n-1,k-1,a,b) + (a(n-1) + bk)S(n-1,k,a,b)$, compute $S(4,2,0,1/2)$:

```
S(4,2,0,1/2) = S(3,1,0,1/2) + ((0)(3) + (1/2)(2))S(3,2,0,1/2)
             = S(3,1,0,1/2) + 1·S(3,2,0,1/2)
             = 2^{1-3}S(3,1) + 1·2^{2-3}S(3,2)
             = 2^{-2}·1 + 2^{-1}·3
             = 1/4 + 3/2
             = 1/4 + 6/4
             = 7/4
             = 1.75
```

## 2. Clustering Exercises

### Exercise 2.1: Simple Barrier Analysis

Consider four points arranged in a square, with distances between adjacent points = 1 and distances across the diagonal = √2.

a) With standard clustering $(a=0, b=1)$, what is the optimal 2-cluster solution?

b) How does the clustering change with half-barriers $(a=0, b=1/2)$?

c) What about negative half-barriers $(a=0, b=-1/2)$?

**Solution**:
a) Standard clustering creates two clusters of two adjacent points each.

b) With half-barriers, the penalty for crossing clusters is reduced, potentially allowing a different configuration where points are grouped diagonally if other factors (not in this simple example) come into play.

c) Negative half-barriers would encourage more cluster boundaries, potentially creating four singleton clusters.

### Exercise 2.2: Network Community Detection

Consider a social network with two densely connected communities and a few bridge links between them.

a) Implement the generalized spectral clustering algorithm with $(a=0, b=1)$ and $(a=0, b=1/2)$.

b) Compare the "blurriness" of the community boundary between the two parameter settings.

c) How does changing $a$ to positive values affect the clustering?

## 3. Parameter Space Exploration

### Exercise 3.1: Parameter Space Visualization

Create a visualization of how the values of $S(6,3,a,b)$ change across the $(a,b)$ parameter space:

- Plot values for $a \in [-1, 1]$ and $b \in [-1, 1]$
- Mark special points like $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, $(0,1/2)$, etc.
- Observe the transitions between different regions

### Exercise 3.2: Finding Optimal Parameters

For a given dataset with known ground truth clusters and barriers:

a) Implement a grid search over $(a,b)$ values to find the optimal parameters that recover the ground truth.

b) Plot the accuracy of clustering as a function of $a$ and $b$.

c) Is there a pattern to where the optimal values tend to lie for different types of datasets?

## 4. Analytical Exercises

### Exercise 4.1: Prove the Hyperbolic Strip Formula

Prove that $S(n,k,0,1/2) = 2^{k-n}S(n,k)$ using:

a) The recurrence relation
b) The exponential generating function

### Exercise 4.2: Sign Patterns

Investigate the sign patterns of $S(n,k,0,-1/2)$ for different values of $n-k \pmod{4}$.

Complete the table and find the pattern:

| $n-k \pmod{4}$ | Sign of $S(n,k,0,-1/2)$ |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| 0              | ? |
| 1              | ? |
| 2              | ? |
| 3              | ? |

## 5. Application Projects

### Project 5.1: Geographic Clustering

Use real geographic data with natural barriers (rivers, mountains):

a) Implement the affinity clustering with barriers framework
b) Experiment with different values of $b$ to represent different barrier strengths
c) Evaluate how well the algorithm respects natural boundaries

### Project 5.2: Comparing Half-Barrier Efficiency

For large clustering problems:

a) Implement algorithms for both standard $(a=0, b=1)$ and half-barrier $(a=0, b=1/2)$ cases
b) Compare computational performance in terms of time and memory usage
c) Analyze numerical stability for large datasets
