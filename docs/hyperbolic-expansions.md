# EGF Expansions of Hyperbolic and Inverse Functions

This document provides the exponential generating function (EGF) expansions of several hyperbolic and inverse functions relevant to generalized Stirling numbers, particularly in the hyperbolic strip region $(a=0, b=±1/2)$.

## Inverse Hyperbolic Sine (arcsinh)

The function $\text{arcsinh}(x)$ appears in connection with generalized Stirling numbers in the $(a,b) \approx (0,-1/2)$ region.

### Standard Taylor Series
$$\text{arcsinh}(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{3x^5}{40} - \frac{5x^7}{112} + \frac{35x^9}{1152} - \cdots$$

### EGF Form
When expressed in the form $\sum_{n≥0} a_n \frac{x^n}{n!}$, the coefficients are:

$$\text{arcsinh}(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + 9\frac{x^5}{5!} - 225\frac{x^7}{7!} + 11025\frac{x^9}{9!} - \cdots$$

**First few EGF coefficients:**
- $a_0 = 0$
- $a_1 = 1$
- $a_2 = 0$
- $a_3 = -1$
- $a_4 = 0$
- $a_5 = 9$
- $a_6 = 0$
- $a_7 = -225$
- $a_8 = 0$
- $a_9 = 11025$

**Pattern:** The coefficients are zero for even indices and alternate in sign for odd indices, with magnitudes that grow rapidly.

### Combinatorial Interpretation

The coefficient $a_{2n+1}$ equals $(-1)^n(2n+1)!/[(2n+1)(2^n n!)^2]$ in absolute value.

These coefficients appear in the context of generalized Stirling numbers with parameters $(a,b) \approx (0,-1/2)$ and represent the "anti-clustering" tendency with half-barrier strength and alternating sign pattern.

## Hyperbolic Sine (sinh)

The function $\sinh(x)$ is the compositional inverse of $\text{arcsinh}(x)$ and appears in the EGF for generalized Stirling numbers with parameters $(a,b) \approx (0,1/2)$.

### Standard Taylor Series
$$\sinh(x) = x + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + \frac{x^7}{7!} + \frac{x^9}{9!} + \cdots$$

### EGF Form
When expressed in EGF form, $\sinh(x)$ has the simple expression:
$$\sinh(x) = \sum_{n≥0} \frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$$

**First few EGF coefficients:**
- $a_0 = 0$
- $a_1 = 1$
- $a_2 = 0$
- $a_3 = 1$
- $a_4 = 0$
- $a_5 = 1$
- $a_6 = 0$
- $a_7 = 1$

**Pattern:** The coefficients are 1 for odd indices and 0 for even indices.

### Key Identity for Hyperbolic Strip

The key identity connecting to the hyperbolic strip:
$$\frac{e^{\pm t/2}-1}{\pm 1/2} = 4e^{\pm t/4}\sinh(t/4)$$

This identity underlies the hyperbolic factorization in the $(a=0, b=±1/2)$ region.

## Special Pattern for Factored EGFs

For the hyperbolic strip, the EGF for fixed $k$ has the form:
$$\sum_{n\geq k} S_{n,k}\left(0,\pm\frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{t^n}{n!} = \frac{4^k}{k!}e^{\pm kt/4}\sinh(t/4)^k$$

When expanded, this gives coefficients that have:
1. The same magnitude (scaled by $2^{k-n}$ relative to classical Stirling numbers)
2. Parity-dependent sign pattern for $b=-1/2$
3. Strict separation between even and odd terms due to $\sinh(t/4)^k$

## Other Related Expansions

### Compositional Inverse Pair: $e^x-1$ and $\ln(1+x)$

#### Expansion of $\ln(1+x)$
$$\ln(1+x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{x^4}{4} + \cdots = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1}\frac{x^n}{n}$$

In EGF form:
$$\ln(1+x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)!\frac{x^n}{n!} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}\frac{x^n}{(n-1)!}$$

These coefficients relate to Stirling numbers of the first kind through the parameters $(a,b)=(1,-1)$.

### Rational Function Pair: $\frac{x}{1-x}$ and $\frac{x}{1+x}$

#### Expansion of $\frac{x}{1+x}$
$$\frac{x}{1+x} = x - x^2 + x^3 - x^4 + \cdots = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1}x^n$$

In EGF form:
$$\frac{x}{1+x} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1}n!\frac{x^n}{n!} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1}\frac{x^n}{0!}$$

These coefficients connect to generalized Stirling numbers with parameters $(a,b)≈(0,-1)$.

## Combinatorial Significance

For combinatorialists, these expansions reveal:

1. **Parity Structure**: The strict even/odd separation in coefficient patterns for hyperbolic functions explains why the generalized Stirling numbers in the hyperbolic strip exhibit such clean parity-based sign patterns.

2. **Magnitude Scaling**: The $2^{k-n}$ scaling factor in the hyperbolic strip represents a "half-strength" effect compared to classical Stirling numbers.

3. **Alternating Signs**: The alternating coefficient pattern in $\text{arcsinh}(x)$ generates the sign pattern $(-1)^{n-k}$ in $S_{n,k}(0,-1/2)$ coefficients.

4. **Growth Rates**: The rapid growth of coefficients in inverse hyperbolic functions explains certain asymptotic behaviors in the corresponding generalized Stirling numbers.

These patterns provide combinatorial insight into the parameter map regions and help explain why certain parameter values like $(a=0, b=±1/2)$ yield particularly elegant formulations.

### Key Points and Summary

1. **Inverse Hyperbolic Sine ($\text{arcsinh}(x)$):** The document shows that the EGF of $\text{arcsinh}(x)$ has a specific and revealing coefficient pattern. Its coefficients are zero for all even powers of $x$, and for odd powers, they alternate in sign. This pattern directly corresponds to the sign-alternating behavior seen in the generalized Stirling numbers $S_{n,k}(0,-1/2)$, which are often associated with "anti-clustering" or "half-strength" effects in combinatorial models.

2. **Hyperbolic Sine ($\sinh(x)$):** As the compositional inverse of $\text{arcsinh}(x)$, $\sinh(x)$ has a much simpler EGF pattern. Its coefficients are 1 for all odd powers of $x$ and 0 for even powers. This clean parity separation is the mathematical foundation for why the generalized Stirling numbers in the hyperbolic strip have such a clear even/odd structure, governed by the identity:

    $$\frac{e^{\pm t/2}-1}{\pm 1/2} = 4e^{\pm t/4}\sinh(t/4)$$

3. **Other Inverse Pairs:** The document extends this concept to other compositionally inverse EGF pairs, such as the natural logarithm $\ln(1+x)$ and the rational function $\frac{x}{1+x}$. It connects these pairs to different parameter values of generalized Stirling numbers, demonstrating how the framework unifies various functional and combinatorial relationships. For instance, the EGF coefficients of $\ln(1+x)$ relate to Stirling numbers of the first kind.

4. **Combinatorial Significance:** The patterns observed in these EGF expansions are not just mathematical curiosities. They provide a direct combinatorial interpretation:
    - The zero coefficients for even powers in $\sinh(x)$ and $\text{arcsinh}(x)$ reveal a **built-in parity filter** in the corresponding generalized Stirling numbers.
    - The alternating signs in $\text{arcsinh}(x)$ explain the **alternating signature** of the $S_{n,k}(0, -1/2)$ numbers.
    - The simple magnitude relationship ($S_{n,k}(0,b) = b^{n-k}S(n,k)$) shows how the parameter $b$ acts as a **scaling factor** on the well-understood classical Stirling numbers.
    - The rapid growth of coefficients in inverse hyperbolic functions explains certain asymptotic behaviors in the corresponding generalized Stirling numbers.

These patterns provide combinatorial insight into the parameter map regions and help explain why certain parameter values like $(a=0, b=±1/2)$ yield particularly elegant formulations.

## The Remarkable Simplicity of the $(0,1/2)$ Case

The parameter point $(a,b) = (0,1/2)$ reveals a striking simplicity in the coefficient structure that deserves special attention:

### Pure Coefficient Pattern

For the hyperbolic sine function that appears in the $(0,1/2)$ case:
$$\sinh(x) = \sum_{n≥0} \frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$$

The EGF coefficients are uniformly 1 for all odd powers - the simplest non-trivial coefficient pattern possible. This stands in stark contrast to almost every other special function in this parameter space, including:

- Classical Stirling numbers $(0,1)$: Complex combinatorial patterns
- First kind Stirling numbers $(1,0)$: Alternating signs with factorial growth
- Lah numbers $(1,1)$: Rapid growth rate with binomial structure
- Even other points on the hyperbolic strip $(0,-1/2)$: Alternating signs

### Computational Advantages

This simplicity offers significant computational benefits:
1. **Exact calculations**: No approximation errors in coefficient generation
2. **Memory efficiency**: No need to store complex coefficient patterns
3. **Algorithmic simplicity**: Direct formula implementation without recursion
4. **Symbolic manipulation**: Clean algebraic properties for formal manipulations

### Combinatorial Interpretation

From a combinatorial perspective, this unit coefficient pattern means:

1. **Unweighted counting**: Unlike most generalized Stirling numbers that apply weights to different configurations, the $(0,1/2)$ case represents a "pure" or "unbiased" counting of certain structures with simple scaling

2. **Perfect balance**: The factor $e^{kt/4}$ perfectly balances the otherwise complex patterns from $\sinh(t/4)^k$, resulting in the clean coefficient structure

3. **Partitioning simplicity**: For any fixed $k$, the generating function $\frac{4^k}{k!}e^{kt/4}\sinh(t/4)^k$ counts partitions with a consistent "half-barrier" weighting that maintains perfect proportionality to the classical Stirling numbers

### Connection to Classical Values

The relationship:
$$S_{n,k}(0,1/2) = 2^{k-n}S(n,k)$$

Shows that the $(0,1/2)$ case provides the cleanest possible scaling transformation of classical Stirling numbers. This is the purest demonstration of the "half-barrier" effect, offering:

1. **Simplified asymptotics**: Cleaner behavior as $n,k$ grow large
2. **Consistent magnitude relationship**: Fixed scaling by powers of 2
3. **No sign alternation**: Preserves the sign pattern of classical Stirling numbers

### An Anchoring Point in the Parameter Space

The $(0,1/2)$ point serves as an important "anchor" in the parameter space:
- It's exactly midway between no barrier $(b=0)$ and full barrier $(b=1)$
- It maintains positivity unlike its counterpart $(0,-1/2)$
- It provides the simplest non-trivial scale transformation of classical Stirling numbers

This simplicity suggests that the $(0,1/2)$ parameter point may be more fundamental to the underlying combinatorial structure than even the classical $(0,1)$ case in certain applications.
