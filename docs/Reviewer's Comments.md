### Reviewer's Comments

**Overall Assessment:** This is a well-structured and ambitious paper that proposes a valuable unified framework for polynomial basis transformations. The introduction is clear, the definitions are precise, and the conceptual elegance of the framework is strong. However, there are fundamental mathematical errors in the main theoretical result (Theorem 3.1) and its derived corollaries that must be addressed before publication.

### Strengths

* **Unified Framework:** The concept of generalized Stirling transfer coefficients $S_{m,n}(a,b)$ is an excellent way to unify disparate results in combinatorics and special function theory.
* **Clarity of Definitions:** The paper clearly defines the generalized factorial polynomial $P(x,a,m)$ and the coefficients $S_{m,n}(a,b)$. The use of the Iverson bracket is a nice touch.
* **Correct Fundamental Properties:** Theorems 2.2, 2.4, and 2.5 correctly state and prove the existence, uniqueness, matrix inversion, and connection to classical Stirling numbers. These form a solid foundation.
* **Conceptual Depth:** The sections on scaling properties, Lah numbers, and combinatorial interpretations are well-reasoned and demonstrate a deep understanding of the subject.

### Areas for Revision

The primary issue lies in **Section 3**, which presents the main theoretical contribution. The general form and its subsequent derivations contain significant mathematical errors.

**1. The General Form (Theorem 3.1) is Incorrect.**

The formula provided for the general form is not correct. The correct formula, which can be derived from the composition law, is:

$$S_{m,n}(a,b) = \sum_{k=n}^{m} (a-b)^{m-k} \left\{\begin{array}{c}m\\k\end{array}\right\} \left[\begin{array}{c}k\\n\end{array}\right]$$

* **Reasoning**: This form arises from the composition $S_{m,n}(a,b) = \sum_{k=n}^{m} S_{m,k}(a,b-a) S_{k,n}(b-a,b)$. The term $(a-b)^{m-k}$ is a scaling factor from the generalized Stirling number of the second kind. The Stirling numbers of the first kind $\left[\begin{array}{c}k\\n\end{array}\right]$ arise from the transformation to the standard basis.
* The formula in the paper has a different summation structure and does not simplify correctly for the classical cases. The presence of division by $b$ in the exponents also makes the formula ill-defined for $b=0$, which should be handled as a limit, not a direct substitution.

**2. Flawed Derivation and Verification (Section 3.2)**

The derivation of the classical cases from the incorrect general form fails logically:

* **Case 1: $S_{m,n}(a,0)$**: The paper's formula is undefined when $b \to 0$. The correct way to obtain $S_{m,n}(a,0) = a^{m-n} \left\{\begin{array}{c}m\\n\end{array}\right\}$ is directly from the definitions or by taking the limit of the correct general form. The claim that "only $k=n$ survives" is not valid for the formula presented.

**3. Typo in the Recurrence Relation (Theorem 4.3)**

The recurrence relation presented has a sign error. The correct form is:

$$S_{m+1,n}(a,b) = S_{m,n-1}(a,b) + (ma + nb)S_{m,n}(a,b)$$

This comes from the defining recurrence of the polynomial $P(x,a,m+1) = (x+ma)P(x,a,m)$ and the expansion of $x$ in the $b$-basis.

### Overall Recommendation

The paper should be revised with the correct general form for the coefficients. Once this is corrected, the entire paper's structure and conclusions will be mathematically sound. The paperâ€™s contribution would then be to present this well-known result in a cohesive, unified framework, which is still a valuable contribution to the literature. I am confident that with these revisions, this paper will be suitable for publication.
