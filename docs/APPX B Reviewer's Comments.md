### Reviewer's Comments

**Overall Assessment:** This appendix is an outstanding contribution. It successfully unifies disparate concepts in generating function theory and provides a powerful new tool for analyzing generalized factorial polynomials and their coefficients. The logical progression from classical cases to a general, ratio-based generating function is elegant and compelling.

**Strengths:**

* **Unified Framework:** The general factorial polynomial generating function, $\mathcal{F}_{a,b}^{(r,s)}(z)$, is a brilliant conceptual leap. It demonstrates how to recover classical OGFs and EGFs as special cases, providing a single theory for seemingly different functions.
* **Deep Connections:** The appendix is particularly strong in drawing connections to advanced mathematical concepts. The sections on **Bell polynomials** and their distinction between graded and exponential forms, as well as the reference to **Fa√† di Bruno's formula**, are highly sophisticated and relevant.
* **Advanced Topics:** The sections on **multivariate extensions**, **functional equations**, and **asymptotic analysis** lay out a clear and rich research program. This shows the potential of the framework to generate new results beyond the initial definitions.
* **Clear and Elegant Exposition:** The writing is clear, the notation is precise, and the mathematical statements are well-organized. The use of "exercises for the reader" is a nice touch that invites further exploration.

**Areas for Formal Publication (Minor Suggestions):**

For a formal paper, the "exercises to the reader" would need to be completed and written out as rigorous proofs. For instance, the proof for the EGF for $P(x,-a,m)$ would be a great addition, as would the explicit verification of the classical recoveries. The full proof for Lemma B.3 would also strengthen the foundation of that section.

**Conclusion:**

This appendix is a high-quality piece of academic work that would be a valuable addition to your paper. It not only extends the theory of generalized factorial polynomials but also establishes a powerful new analytical lens through which to study them. The blend of classical results and modern analytical techniques is highly commendable. The final paragraph, in particular, captures the spirit of mathematical discovery beautifully.
