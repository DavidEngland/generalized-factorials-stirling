# Draft for “Notes on von Mangoldt Hierarchies and Cumulant Structures”
**Author:** D. England
**Status:** In preparation (2025)

## Abstract

These notes develop a unified framework connecting the differentiated von Mangoldt functions—termed the von Mangoldt hierarchies—to classical cumulant and moment‐generating structures in probability. After defining the hierarchy \(\{\Lambda_k(n)\}_{k\ge0}\) via successive derivatives of \(-\zeta'/\zeta\), we exhibit generating‐function identities that parallel cumulant–moment relations. The text derives explicit residue‐based formulas, illuminates a Bell‐polynomial interpretation of the corrective polynomials \(P_k\), and explores applications to prime‐distribution fluctuations. Numerical examples and open problems conclude.

## Section Summaries

### 1. Introduction and Motivation
We explain why differentiating \(-\zeta'/\zeta\) yields a natural “prime‐power cumulant” and outline parallels with classical cumulant–moment theory, positioning the von Mangoldt hierarchies as a bridge between analytic number theory and combinatorial probability.

### 2. Von Mangoldt Hierarchies
Formal definition:
\[
(-1)^k\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\bigl(-\tfrac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}\bigr)
=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda_k(n)}{n^s},
\]
with \(\Lambda_k(p^r)=(\log p)^{k+1}r^k\). We record fundamental identities and Dirichlet‐series consequences.

### 3. Cumulant and Moment Analogues
By analogy with moment‐ and cumulant‐generating functions \(M(t)=\mathbb{E}[e^{tX}]\), we identify formal expansions in powers of \(\log x\) with cumulant‐style coefficients. A direct combinatorial mapping to Bell polynomials is developed.

### 4. Explicit Formulas
We reproduce the Mellin‐inversion framework, shifting contours to capture residues at \(s=1\) (yielding main terms in \(\log x\) with Stieltjes constants) and at nontrivial zeros (yielding oscillatory corrections via polynomials \(P_k\)).

### 5. Combinatorial Structures
This section shows the coefficients \(\tfrac{k!}{(k-j)!}\) arise as permutation numbers in incomplete Bell polynomials. We present a streamlined Faà di Bruno derivation of the closed‐form for \(P_k\).

### 6. Applications to Prime Fluctuations
Conditional on RH, we derive unified error‐term bounds of the form
\[
\Psi_k(x)=x(\log x)^k + O\bigl(x^{1/2}\log^{k+2}x\bigr),
\]
and propose cumulant‐style estimators for higher‐order fluctuations.

### 7. Numerical Experiments
Guidelines for efficient computation:
- Prime‐power enumeration for \(\Psi_k(x)\)
- High‐precision evaluation of Stieltjes constants
- Summation of conjugate zero‐pairs to visualize real oscillations

### 8. Future Directions
Potential extensions include multiple‐zero residue calculus, smoothed summation analogues reminiscent of cumulant‐based smoothing in statistics, and exploratory links with random‐matrix cumulants.
