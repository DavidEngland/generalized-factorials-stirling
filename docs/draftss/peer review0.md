This draft is exceptionally well-structured — it already reads like the front matter and working summary of a polished research preprint. The overall flow (definition → analogy → explicit formulas → combinatorial interpretation → applications → experiments) is coherent, rigorous, and pedagogically sound.

Here are targeted editorial and technical suggestions that could help refine it toward submission or extended exposition:

🧭 Structural & Expository Improvements
	1.	Add a compact “notation and conventions” table early in §2 (before equation (2.1)).
Include:
	•	\Lambda_k(p^r), P_k(\rho,\log x), and \Psi_k(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda_k(n).
	•	Short statements on sign and differentiation conventions (to avoid ambiguity with the alternating signs from (-1)^k \frac{d^k}{ds^k}).
	2.	Insert a bridging paragraph between §§3 and 4.
Suggest title: “From Formal Series to Analytic Continuation.”
It could explain how the cumulant interpretation motivates the contour-shifting used in §4, emphasizing that residues at zeros correspond to “statistical cumulants” of prime fluctuations.
	3.	Clarify the role of P_k vs. the Bell polynomials:
Explicitly state whether P_k is itself a Bell polynomial or a linear image thereof under the differential operator. This will make the combinatorial–analytic link more direct.
	4.	Cross-reference Mellin inversion steps with precise theorems (e.g., Perron’s formula, the explicit formula for \psi(x)). A numbered theorem or “Proposition 4.1 (Residue form of von Mangoldt hierarchy)” would anchor the reader.
	5.	Add a short “Notation vs. Probability Table” at the end of §3:

Number Theory	Probability
\Lambda_k	k-th cumulant
\Psi_k(x)	moment sum
-\zeta’/\zeta	log MGF

🔬 Technical & Mathematical Refinements
	1.	Check sign conventions in the hierarchy definition:
(-1)^k \frac{d^k}{ds^k}\Bigl(-\frac{\zeta’}{\zeta}\Bigr)
Often written without the outer minus, so verify that \Lambda_0(n)=\Lambda(n).
	2.	When introducing incomplete Gamma, specify the substitution that relates x^s and \Gamma(\alpha,\log x): e.g.,
x^s = e^{s\log x} = \int_0^\infty t^{s-1} e^{-t/\log x}\,\frac{dt}{\log x}.
This shows precisely why \alpha=-1/\rho is the natural parameter.
	3.	Polynomials P_k:
Consider presenting a closed recurrence (e.g. P_{k+1}= (\log x+\partial_\rho) P_k)—this makes numerical generation straightforward and clarifies their link with Bell derivatives.
	4.	Stieltjes–constant polynomial at s=1
Including an explicit low-order example (k=1,2) using
\gamma_m = \lim_{n\to\infty}\Big(\sum_{r\le n}\frac{(\log r)^m}{r}-\frac{(\log n)^{m+1}}{m+1}\Big)
would ground the theory for readers less familiar with these constants.
	5.	Residue computations:
You may want to highlight that b_{k,j}(\rho) ultimately depend on \zeta^{(m)}(\rho), hence the entire hierarchy is controlled by the jet of \zeta at its zeros.

🧩 Computational / Numerical Notes
	•	For §7, consider giving pseudocode or a Sage / Python outline:

for k in range(K):
    for n in prime_powers_up_to(x):
        psi_k += (log(p))**(k+1) * r**k

and compare against zero-sum reconstruction using pretabulated zeros.

	•	Plot suggestion:
x^{-1/2}\bigl(\Psi_k(x)-x(\log x)^k\bigr) vs. \log x to show zero-driven oscillations scaled by RH prediction.

🌐 Possible Future Appendices
	•	Appendix A: Numerical methods for \partial_\alpha^j\Gamma(\alpha,z) (complex α).
	•	Appendix B: Table of first few P_k(\rho,\log x) explicitly.
	•	Appendix C: Connection to random-matrix cumulants — a short outline comparing to \mathrm{Tr}\,U^n cumulant structures.

⸻

🖋️ Stylistic Tweaks
	•	Replace repeated “we show” with a mix of “we derive,” “we exhibit,” “we interpret” for smoother flow.
	•	Enclose heuristic or experimental paragraphs in visually distinct boxes or shaded notes (in LaTeX, \begin{tcolorbox} or \begin{quote}).
