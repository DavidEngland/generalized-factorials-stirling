# The Full Hasse Operator: Key Properties and Applications

## 1. Definition and Basic Properties

The full Hasse shift operator $\mathcal{H}$ is defined as the infinite sum over all orders of the partial Hasse operators:

$$\mathcal{H}(f)(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \mathcal{H}_m(f)(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \sum_{n=0}^{m} H_{m,n} f(x+n)$$

where the Hasse coefficients $H_{m,n}$ are given by:

$$H_{m,n} = \frac{(-1)^n \binom{m}{n}}{m+1}$$

**Key Properties:**
- **Linearity**: $\mathcal{H}(af + bg) = a\mathcal{H}(f) + b\mathcal{H}(g)$
- **Normalization**: For $m \geq 1$, $\sum_{n=0}^{m} H_{m,n} = 0$
- **Annihilation of Constants**: $\mathcal{H}_m(c) = 0$ for $m \geq 1$, any constant $c$
- **Identity on Constants**: $\mathcal{H}(c) = c$ for any constant $c$

## 2. Series Expansions and Transformations

When applied to power series, the Hasse operator acts as a transformation between bases:

$$\mathcal{H}(x^n) = \begin{cases}
B_n(x)/n! & \text{if } n \geq 1 \\
1 & \text{if } n = 0
\end{cases}$$

where $B_n(x)$ are the Bernoulli polynomials.

For a general power series $f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$:

$$\mathcal{H}(f)(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \frac{B_n(x)}{n!}$$

This transforms the standard power basis into the Bernoulli basis, providing an alternative representation that often reveals hidden analytical properties.

## 3. Connection to Bernoulli Polynomials

The Bernoulli polynomials $B_n(x)$ have a direct representation via the Hasse operator:

$$B_n(x) = n! \cdot \mathcal{H}(x^n)$$

This can be derived through the exponential generating function:

$$\frac{te^{xt}}{e^t-1} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} B_n(x) \frac{t^n}{n!}$$

By applying the Hasse operator to $e^{tx}$, we get:

$$\mathcal{H}(e^{tx})(x) = \frac{t \cdot e^{tx}}{e^t-1}$$

Comparing coefficients of $t^n$ establishes the relationship between Hasse operations and Bernoulli polynomials.

## 4. Application to Special Functions

### Logarithmic Functions

For the logarithmic function and its powers:

$$\mathcal{H}([\log(t)]^k)(x) = -k \cdot \gamma_{k-1}(x)$$

where $\gamma_{k-1}(x)$ is the $(k-1)$-th generalized Stieltjes constant.

### Polylogarithm Functions

For polylogarithm functions $\text{Li}_s(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{z^k}{k^s}$:

$$\mathcal{H}([\text{Li}_s(x)]^k)(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} c_j(s,k) \zeta(s+j, x+1)$$

connecting to the Hurwitz zeta function.

### Digamma and Polygamma Functions

The digamma function has the representation:

$$\psi(x) = \mathcal{H}(\log(t))(x)$$

And more generally, the polygamma functions can be expressed through the Hasse operator applied to powers of logarithms.

## 5. Optimizing Calculations via Recurrence Relations

The Hasse coefficients satisfy the recurrence relation:

$$H_{m+1,n} = H_{m,n-1} - \frac{m+1-n}{m+2} \cdot H_{m,n}$$

for $1 \leq n \leq m+1$, with boundary conditions $H_{m,0} = \frac{1}{m+1}$.

This recurrence can be leveraged in multiple ways:

1. **Efficient Coefficient Generation**: Build a triangular array of coefficients using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Progressive Refinement**: Compute higher-order approximations incrementally by adding only the new terms.

3. **Parallelizable Computation**: The recurrence allows for parallel computation of coefficients at the same level.

For numerical applications, this recurrence dramatically reduces the computational complexity from $O(m^2n)$ to $O(mn)$ when calculating Hasse coefficients for large orders.

## 6. Umbral Calculus Perspective

The Hasse operator fits naturally within the framework of umbral calculus, where it can be understood as a specific "umbral shift" operator.

Key umbral calculus insights:

1. **Operator Representation**: The Hasse operator can be expressed in terms of forward difference and shift operators:

   $$\mathcal{H}_m = \frac{1}{m+1} \sum_{k=0}^{m} (-1)^k \binom{m}{k} E^k$$

   where $E^k$ is the shift operator $E^k f(x) = f(x+k)$.

2. **Sheffer Sequence Connection**: Bernoulli polynomials form a Sheffer sequence, and the Hasse operator reveals their umbral character directly.

3. **Symbolic Computation**: Using umbral notation, complex calculations with Hasse operators can be simplified:

   $$\mathcal{H}(f \circ g) = (\mathcal{H}f) \circ (\mathcal{H}g)$$

   under certain conditions, allowing for compositional calculations.

4. **Generating Function Manipulation**: The umbral approach allows for direct manipulation of generating functions, providing shortcuts for deriving new identities.

Umbral calculus provides a unified framework for understanding both the Hasse operator and its connections to special functions, particularly in the context of generalized Stirling numbers and factorial functions.

## 7. Practical Implementation Considerations

When implementing the Hasse operator numerically:

1. **Precompute Hasse Coefficients**: Store the triangular array of coefficients for reuse.

2. **Reorder Summations**: For functions like logarithmic powers, reordering the summation can improve efficiency:
   ```python
   # Instead of summing over m then n
   for m in range(max_m + 1):
       for n in range(m + 1):
           # Process H_{m,n} * f(x+n)
   
   # Sum over n then m (more efficient)
   for n in range(max_m + 1):
       term_sum = 0
       for m in range(n, max_m + 1):
           term_sum += H_{m,n}
       # Process term_sum * f(x+n)
   ```

3. **Exploit Asymptotic Behavior**: For large orders, use asymptotic approximations of special functions.

4. **Apply Symbolic Transformations**: For some functions, transform to alternative forms before applying the Hasse operator.

By combining these computational strategies with the theoretical insights from umbral calculus, both numerical and symbolic applications of the Hasse operator can be significantly enhanced.
