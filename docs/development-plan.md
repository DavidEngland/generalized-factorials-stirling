Got it! This is a great plan. Let's get you set up with the Git commands and then move on to the Claude Sonnet prompts for generating the Wikipedia-style Markdown.

## Part 1: Git Initialization and First Commit

Assuming you have VS Code open with your newly created repository folder, here are the commands you'll typically run in the integrated terminal (Terminal > New Terminal, or Ctrl+Shift+`):

1.  **Initialize the Git repository:**
    This command creates a new `.git` subdirectory in your current directory, which is where all of Git's version control magic happens.

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

    *Expected output:* `Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/your/repo/.git/`

2.  **Create your `README.md` and `LICENSE.md` files:**
    You can do this directly in VS Code by creating new files or using the terminal. Let's assume you've just created them in VS Code.

3.  **Add your files to the staging area:**
    This tells Git which files you want to include in your next commit. `.` means "all files in the current directory and subdirectories."

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

    *No output usually means success.*

4.  **Commit your changes:**
    This saves the staged changes to your local repository's history. The `-m` flag allows you to provide a commit message directly.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Set up repository with README and LICENSE"
    ```

    *Expected output:* Something like `[master (root-commit) <hash>] Initial commit: Set up repository with README and LICENSE` followed by details on file changes.

5.  **Set the branch name (optional, but good practice for new repos):**
    Historically, the default branch was `master`. Many modern projects use `main`. It's good to explicitly set it.

    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```

    *No output usually means success.*

6.  **Connect your local repository to your GitHub remote:**
    You'll need the URL of the empty repository you created on GitHub. Replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>` with that URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`).

    ```bash
    git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
    ```

    *No output usually means success.*

7.  **Push your local changes to GitHub:**
    This uploads your committed changes from your local `main` branch to the `origin` remote's `main` branch. The `-u` flag sets the upstream, so future `git push` commands can be run without specifying `origin main`.

    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

    *You'll likely be prompted to enter your GitHub username and Personal Access Token (PAT), or it might open a browser for authentication.*

**You've now successfully initialized your Git repository and pushed your initial files to GitHub!**

## Part 2: Claude Sonnet Prompts for Generalized Polynomials (Wikipedia Style)

Now for generating the content. Remember, for a "Wikipedia-style" article, Claude Sonnet should focus on:

  * **Neutral point of view:** Objective and fact-based.
  * **Structured headings:** H1 for title, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections.
  * **Clear definitions:** Define terms precisely.
  * **Examples:** Illustrate concepts.
  * **Mathematical notation:** Use standard LaTeX or Markdown for equations.
  * **Historical context (optional but good):** Briefly mention originators if relevant.
  * **Applications (briefly):** Where are these polynomials used?
  * **No Stirling numbers mentioned yet:** Crucial constraint for this phase.

Here's a sequence of prompts to guide Claude Sonnet. You might need to iterate and refine based on its initial output.

**Prompt 1: Introduction and Definition**

> "I need a Wikipedia-style article section on 'Generalized Factorial Polynomials'. Start with a main heading 'Generalized Factorial Polynomials'.
>
> In the first section, 'Definition', provide a clear mathematical definition of both generalized rising factorials and generalized falling factorials. Explain their notation, such as $x^{\overline{m}}_a$ or $(x)_m,a$ for rising, and $x^{\underline{m}}_a$ or $(x)_m^a$ for falling. Define them as products: $x(x+a)(x+2a)\cdots(x+(m-1)a)$ for rising and $x(x-a)(x-2a)\cdots(x-(m-1)a)$ for falling, where $m$ is a non-negative integer and $a$ is a non-zero constant. Explain the special cases when $a=1$ (standard rising/falling factorials) and $a=0$.
>
> Use appropriate Markdown for headings and mathematical expressions. Do NOT mention Stirling numbers or coefficients at all."

**Prompt 2: Properties and Identities**

> "Continuing the Wikipedia-style article on 'Generalized Factorial Polynomials', write a section titled 'Properties and Identities'.
>
> Discuss the relationship between generalized rising and falling factorials (e.g., $x^{\overline{m}}_a = (x+(m-1)a)^{\underline{m}}_a$).
>
> Explain their connection to the Gamma function, showing the formula:
> $x^{\overline{m}}_a = a^m \frac{\Gamma(x/a + m)}{\Gamma(x/a)}$
> And similarly for falling factorials.
>
> Briefly touch upon other basic properties, such as for $m=0$ and how they behave when $x=0$.
>
> Use clear Markdown and mathematical notation. Do NOT mention Stirling numbers or coefficients."

**Prompt 3: Special Cases and Examples**

> "Add a section to the Wikipedia-style article on 'Generalized Factorial Polynomials' titled 'Special Cases and Examples'.
>
> Elaborate on the common special case where $a=1$, relating it to the standard rising and falling factorials (Pochhammer symbol).
>
> Provide a clear example for both a generalized rising factorial (e.g., $x^{\overline{3}}_2$) and a generalized falling factorial (e.g., $x^{\underline{4}}_3$), expanding them out fully.
>
> Briefly mention the trivial case where $a=0$ (e.g., $x^m$).
>
> Ensure Markdown and mathematical notation are correct. Do NOT mention Stirling numbers or coefficients."

**Prompt 4: Applications (Briefly)**

> "For the 'Generalized Factorial Polynomials' article, add a short section titled 'Applications'.
>
> Briefly list fields where these polynomials are used, such as:
>
>   * Finite difference calculus
>   * The theory of special functions (e.g., hypergeometric series)
>   * Combinatorics (particularly the $a=1$ case)
>
> Keep this section concise. Do NOT mention Stirling numbers or coefficients."

**After receiving output from each prompt:**

1.  **Copy and paste:** Take Claude's Markdown output and paste it into your `generalized-factorials-stirling.md` (or similar) file in VS Code.
2.  **Review and refine:** Read through the generated content.
      * Does it flow well?
      * Are there any inaccuracies or awkward phrasings?
      * Is the Markdown correct? (Sometimes LLMs can make small errors with complex math syntax).
      * **Crucially: Did it avoid mentioning Stirling numbers?** If it did, edit them out and give corrective feedback to Claude if you want to reuse the prompt.
3.  **Save your file.**
4.  **Commit your changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add initial content for Generalized Factorial Polynomials section"
    git push origin main
    ```

By breaking it down, you'll get more focused and accurate results from Claude Sonnet, and it will be easier for you to review and manage the content generation process. Good luck!
